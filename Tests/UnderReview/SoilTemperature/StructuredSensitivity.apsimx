          "Text": "SoilTemperature uses a numerical solution to the heat flow equation to find soil temperature at any depth. In principle, the numerical solution is sensitive to the layering but the extent of has not previously been tested in APSIM. Because the model will be used with both SWIM (think surface layers) and SoilWater (thick surface layers) it is important to understand any sensitivity.\n\nA simple simulation was set up using a ‘dummy’ model to hold soil water contents constant as the purpose here is to test the soil temperature simulation not the soil water simulation. Both simulations had soil extending to 1100 mm deep. The thin-layering simulation had 11 layers with the top layer 2 mm deep and with seven layers in the top 100 mm. The thick-layering simulation had six layers with only one layer in the top 100 mm – a value typical for simulations using SoilWater.\n\nThe first three plots below compare the simulated soil temperature across three depths with the thin layering in black and the thick layering in orange. Plots 3 to 6 show patterns of daily average (plot 4) and maximum (plots 5 and 6) soil temperature across depths for the thin layering (plots 4 and 5) and thick layering (plot 6). Note that the depths of 1, 8 and 15 mm all fall in the top layer of the thick-layering simulation but are in layers 1, 3, 4, and 8 of the thin-layering simulation.\n\nOverall, the simulations showed low sensitivity to the differences in layering (Plots 1-3). There was a greater difference in simulated maximum temperature than average temperature. For example, on 22 October the average soil temperature at 1 mm for the thin layering was 29 C v’s 28 for the thick layering (Plots 5 and 6). The differences in maximum temperature are greater than for average temperature. Plot 5 show a maximum temperature at 1 mm of 36 C for the thin layering v’s 33 C for the thick layering in Plot 6. It is possible that these differences may be important in future simulation purposes but these are minor differences when viewed from the perspective of must current uses.\n\nIt must be emphasised that this test is on the soil temperature model only. Layering will have a much more substantial effect on soil water contents when a soil water simulation model is included in the simulation and the differences in soil water content will feed through to greater differences in the simulated soil temperature. Users should be aware of this when deciding which soil water model to use.\n\n",
