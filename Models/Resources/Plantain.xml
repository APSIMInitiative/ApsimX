## Presentation

This model has been built using the Plant Modelling Framework (PMF) of [brown_plant_2014] to simulate the growth of a forage plantain crop ( _Plantago lanceolata_ ).  The model focus, thus, on describing primarily the vegetative growth, with a simplified account of the reproductive phase, without explicit considering flowers and seeds (these may be included in future releases).  To simulate the aboveground plant structure, including the photosynthesis process, the plantain model uses the SimpleLeaf procedure of PMF.  The model describes a semi-perennial crop, with phenology rewinding to the vegetative stage at the end of the reproductive phase.


##Inclusion in APSIM simulations
A forage plantain crop can be included in a simulation the same as any other APSIM crop.

 * - The plantain object can be dragged or copied from the Crop folder in the tool box into a Field in your simulation;
 * - To become active and grow, plantain needs to be sown using a manager script with a sowing rule. e.g.:
~~~
 Plantain.Sow(cultivar: Tonic, population: 300, depth: 10, rowSpacing: 150);  
~~~
If a specified cultivar is not available, a fatal error will be thrown.


###Harvest and biomass removal
Plantain biomass can be removed by raising one of the valid methods: Harvest, Cut, Graze, or Prune; this is done using a manager script, similarly to other crops.  The proportion of the biomass of each organ that is removed from the system and/or added to the residue pools may be specified; otherwise defaults will be used.  Note that the sum of fractions removed and added to residue should be <= 1.0.  To specify the proportions for removal in a manager script, use a RemovalFractions class as shown below:
~~~
[EventSubscribe("Commencing")]  
private void OnSimulationCommencing(object sender, EventArgs e)  
{  
  RemoveFraction = new RemovalFractions(Plantain.Organs);  
}  
[EventSubscribe("DoManagement")]    
private void OnDoManagement(object sender, EventArgs e)  
{  
  if (Clock.Today.Date == HarvestDate)  
  {  
    RemoveFraction.SetFractionToRemove("Leaf", 0.80);  
    RemoveFraction.SetFractionToRemove("Stem", 0.50);  
    RemoveFraction.SetFractionToResidue("leaf",0.05);
    Plantain.Harvest(RemoveFraction);  
  }
}  
~~~
The RemovalFractions class can be sent with Harvest, Cut, Graze, or Prune events. All parameters are optional, defaults are used whenever any value is not specified.


###Crop termination
To fully terminate a crop the EndCrop event should be raised:
~~~
 Plantain.EndCrop();  
~~~
Once a crop has been ended the field is open to be used by another APSIM plant model, or another plantain crop.  Note that ending plantain is not necessary before sowing another crop, competition for resources will take place between crops when there is more than one in the field.

        <MemoText><![CDATA[The thermal time is calculated from the daily average temperature using three cardinal temperatures: minimum, maximum, and optimum.  Crop development acelerates as temperature increases from minimum to optimum and slows down after that, stopping completely when maximum temperature is reached.  There is very little information about these thresholds for plantain, the minimum temperature seem to be quite variable as one of the main traits that vary among cultivars is the growth over winter. For "chinese plantain" ( _Plantago  asiatica_ ) the minimum temperature varies between 3 and 14 oC ([IshikawaEtAl_2007]), which gives an idea of potential variations for this parameter in plantain. Plantain is tolerant to high temperatures ([StewartPlantain_1996]; [NieEtAl_2008]) and outgrows ryegrass over summer in subtropical climate ([MoorheadPigot_2009]). The data for chinese plantain suggest similar growth, and thus the optimum and maximum temperature for it, 30 and 38oC respectively ([IshikawaEtAl_2007]), should give a good indication of the values for forage plantain.

Variations in germination rate due to depth are not explicitly simulated by the plantain model in the current version, however the sowing depth does affect timing of emergence.  This is controlled by the parameter ShootRate, which is the shoot elongation rate as function of thermal time (mm/oCd).

        <MemoText><![CDATA[During this phase the plant only partitions biomass to leaf and root+taproot organs.  The phase starts when plants emerge from the ground, but it is also triggered after the end of the reproductive phase (phenology reset).  It ends when the reproductive phase starts, which is triggered by the accumulation of days with long sunlight ([SussexPlantain_1956]; [Rowarth_Plantain_1990]; [CaseLaceyHopkins_1996]; [LaceyRoach_2003]; [GonzalezParrado_2015]).  Stalk development have been recorded to start in October in NZ and in May in the USA ([Rowarth_Plantain_1990]; [LaceyRoach_2003]; [SandersonEtAl_2003]), with data suggesting a minimum of 25-30 days (non consecutive) with long daylight periods ([SussexPlantain_1956]; [FajerEtAl_1991]; [CaseLaceyHopkins_1996]).  The literature does not provide an indication of how long the sunlight period should be to trigger the reproductive phase, but it is clear that daylight should be grater that the period in darkness (14-16 hours been used to induce flowering in growth chambers).  The base plantain model uses the accumulation of days greater than 12hrs to trigger the end of the vegetative phase.

        <MemoText><![CDATA[During this phase the plant is partitioning biomass to all organs, including reproductive organs (stems, flowers, and seeds). Flower stages and seeds development are not explicitly described in the current model, only a generic organ refered to as _inflorescence_ is defined.  This was done partly due to lack of data and partly because of the variability and complex phenology of plantain.  There is a lot of variation among plantain plants regarding when flowering occurs and how long it lasts, plus even the same plant can have flowering stalks, stalks with young seeds, as well as stalks with ripen seed at the same time ([Rowarth_Plantain_1990]; [RumballKeog_1997]; [LaceyRoach_2003]; [GonzalezParrado_2015]).  Seed ripenning is reached some 8-10 weeks after flowering, with commercial cultivars closer to the low end of the range.  The available data suggest an accumulation of 450oCd for the flowering period, with base temperature between 5 and 9oC ([Rowarth_Plantain_1990]; [RumballKeog_1997]; [GonzalezParrado_2015]).  Howerver flowering continues throughout the summer into autumn and seem to be curtailed only by frosts ([Rowarth_Plantain_1990]) and/or short days ([SandersonEtAl_2003]).  In the plantain model the photoperiod is used to define the end of reproductive phase, following the same approach used to start it.  And correspondelly, the accumulation of days shorter than 12 hours is used as the trigger the end of the phase (this approach also ensures phenology reset even in warmer climates).  Note that the DM partition functions also use photoperiod to change priority allocation into reproductive organs, with maximum allocation only when daylight length is greater than 14hours.  This was done to limit the allocation to reproductive organs on the sason shoulders when only few plants are actively in the reproductive phase (e.g. [SandersonEtAl_2003]).

        <MemoText><![CDATA[Data for photosynthesys in plantain is very sparse and so some of the data used here are from studies that employed wild varieties.  Values for CO2 assimilation rates are generally consistent ([PootDenBroek_1997]; [LabreveuxThesis_2002]; [vanDenBergeEtAl_2014]; [CranstonEtAl_2015]) and follow a classic relationhip with light intensity (directly proportional) as well with N concentration in the leaves (inversely proportional).  Reported values of photosynthetic rate indicate that these are similar or slightly higher in plantain when compared to Chicory ([LabreveuxThesis_2002]; [CranstonEtAl_2015]).  No reported values for RUE were found in the literature, but they can be infered as to be just under 2.0 g DM/MJ for wild vareties ([PootDenBroek_1997]).  
The current model assumes generic responses to enviromental factors, such as temperature and water availability.  Wild plantain is ubiquitous in meadows in subtropical climates around the world, and it is generally assumed to be tollerant to high temperatures but not to cold ([SagarHarper_1964]; [StewartPlantain_1996]).  Forage plantain shows large differences between cultivars, but generally can grow more over winter compared to wild varieties and still outperform temperate grasses in summer ([StewartPlantain_1996]; [MoorheadPigot_2009], [DouglasEtAl_2013]), although survivability in harsh winters in the USA was found to be low ([SandersonEtAl_2003], [SkinnerPlantain_2005]).  Forage plantain is also often mentioned as a drought tollerant species ([StewartPlantain_1996]; [DouglasEtAl_2013]; [QuijadaThesis_2015]), although less so than deep rooted species such as chicory or lucerne.  The use of reserves from the taproots seem to be mechanism used to confer drought resistance in plantain as is the case for many herbs ([CranstonEtAl_2015]; [QuijadaThesis_2015]).

The proportion of the above ground biomass allocated to stems is determined based on the current state and two target ratios, the [TargetStemsLeafRatio].Value and [FlowerStemRatio].Value).  Allocation of biomass to stems can only occur during the reproductive phase.

Taproots are the primary reserve organs and will supply sugars and N to burst growth especially early in spring and following defoliation.  To accomplish this, the taproots' biomass is partioned into structural and non-structural fractions, the later is available to be used in new growth (via biomass retranslocation).  There is very few data on how much reserves are kept in plantain taproots, results from [QuijadaThesis_2015] suggest that sugars plus fructan made up 4-11% of taproots biomass compared to 15-35% in chicory, which is consistent with plantain having much smaller taproots.  Based on these values, and some trial and error, the parameters related to retranslocation (StructuralFraction, DMRetranslocationFactor, and NRetranslocationFactor) were estimated.  These should be upgraded when more data is made available.

Currently only sensitivity to temperature is considered, based on general knowledge from other plant models. The sensitivity of plantain roots to low moisture or water logging is not clear , so this will have to be upgrade in the future when more data is available.  According to [SagarHarper_1964], *P. major*, a similar species, is more tolerant to water logging than *P. lanceolata*, which rarely occurs in water logged sites ([vanTiederen_1992]).

      <MemoText><![CDATA[To ensure prompt regrowth of forage plantain after a defoliation, the model will adjust the allocation of new growth following any defoliation event. This is a simplified approach to biomass allocation plasticity (e.g. [Wilson_1988]; [LevangBrilz_2002]), it assumes that the plant switches allocation of towards leaves whenever the current shoot:root ratio differs from the target value.  
Published data for the shoot:root ratio in plantain is highly variable, with values as low as 1.0 for wild varieties and as high as 6.0 for seedlings of commercial cultivars with no water of nutrient limitations ([SchippersOlff_2000]; [LabreveuxThesis_2002]; [CranstonEtAl_2015]; [PankokeEtAl_2015]).  The data suggests mean values to be around 1.75-2.0 for adult plants.  This value is likely to be affected by environmental conditions, with water or nutrient deficit favouring root growth, while low light conditions leading to higher allocation above ground. However, these relationships can vary considerably in different plants and there is little data for plantain, so the model current ignores the influence of environmental factors on the shoot:root partition, this should be upgraded when data becomes available.

      <MemoText><![CDATA[The  plantain model defines allocation of biomass above ground following a simple approach, it attempts to keep a given proportion among the various organs.  The allocation of biomass to leaves is defined primarily by the target shoo:root ratio, but during the reproductive phase, the partition is further modified based on the ratio of stems+inflorescence to leaves. This ratio may be affected by defoliation ([AyalaEtAl_2011]; [QuijadaThesis_2015]) and is probably affected by enviromental factors too. There is not enough data to describe these interactions.  
Published results suggest that reproductive parts represent a relatively small proportion of the biomass, about 10-25% in grazed swards, and about 40% if not grazed ([SchippersOlff_2000]; [LabreveuxThesis_2002]; [MoorheadPigot_2009]; [AyalaEtAl_2011]).

      <MemoText><![CDATA[The allocation of biomass follows a simple approach in the plantain model.  Allocation during the reproductive phase will attempt to keep a ratio between stem and inflorescence biomass.  This ratio is probably affected by enviromental factors, but there is not data to determine how these would interact.  Because of the short period between stem elongation, flowering and seed maturity, and a relatively long reproductive phase, plantain plants will have ripe seeds as well as young stalks at the same time.  This makes quite difficult to define variation in biomass allocation to inflorescence.  Inference from published values suggest that the ratio of flower biomass to stems varies from around 0.1 to nearly 0.4 ([SchippersOlff_2000]).

      <MemoText><![CDATA[The plantain model assumes that biomass is allocated so to mantain a given proportion of among the various organs (varying with phenological phase and other factors).  The ratio between taproot and root biomass is assumed to vary, increasing with the biomass below ground per plant, approaching a maximum target.  This is a simple approach and can describe the general behaviour of plantain plants, it may be upgraded if deemed necessary when more data becomes available.
