# An APSIM Oat Model

_Zyskowski,R.F, Brown, H.E. and Texiera,E._

The APSIM Oat model has been developed using the Plant Modelling Framework (PMF) of [brown_plant_2014], and is heavily based on  many pricipals implemented within. This framework provides a library of plant organ and process submodels that can be coupled, at runtime, to construct a model in much the same way that models can be coupled to construct a simulation. This means that dynamic composition of lower level process and organ classes (e.g. photosynthesis, leaf) into larger constructions (e.g. maize, wheat, sorghum) can be achieved by the model developer without additional coding.

The model consists of:

* a phenology model to simulate development between growth phases  
* a structure model to simulate plant morphology  
* a collection of organs to simulate the various plant parts  
* an arbitrator to allocate resources (N, biomass) to the various plant organs

Martin, R. J. and I. N. C. Agron Soc New Zealand (1996). The effect of sowing date on growth and yield of two cultivars of oats.
	Oats cvs. Cashel and Drummond were sown at Lincoln on 16 September, 2 November, and 21 December 1994; and on 7 February, 3 April, and 16 May 1995 in order to compare the effect of sowing date on their growth and yield. Biomass and leaf area were measured at one to four-week intervals from the end of tillering. Crops grew for periods ranging from just over 100 days to nearly 300 days. The crop sown in February died before maturity, and the one sown in April was affected by frost. Biomass production was much higher for the April sowing (over 20 t/ha) than the 7.5-15 t/ha for the other sowings, and was higher for Drummond than for Cashel at all sowing dates. Leaf area indices did not exceed 4.5 except for the February and April sowings of Drummond. There was a strong linear relationship between cumulative biomass production and intercepted radiation for all sowing dates, with the same rate of increase in biomass with radiation increase for both cultivars. Grain yields estimated from quadrat samples were higher than header yields for all sowings, but especially for the April sowing in which grain weights and harvest indices were lower than for the other sowings. Fifty-seven percent of grain yield came from post anthesis photosynthesis and 43% from remobilization from other plant parts. Oat yield is dependent on the amount of radiation intercepted by the crop and harvest index. Changes in conversion of radiation to biomass were not significantly affected by the range of conditions experienced by the crops in this study.

Martin, R. J., et al. Effects of Timing and Intensity of Drought on the Yield of Oats (Avena sativa L.). Australian Agronomy
Hobart.
	The response of oats (Avena sativa L.) to timing and intensity of drought was determined in a mobile
rainshelter, which excluded rainfall during crop growth. Ten irrigation treatments subjected the crops to
drought of varying duration at different stages during plant growth; the crops were otherwise fully
irrigated. Oat grain yield generally increased linearly with cumulative water use, and decreased linearly as
the maximum potential soil moisture deficit experienced during crop growth increased, regardless of the
timing of drought. The exception to this was the no drought (fully irrigated) treatment, where lodging
reduced panicle number and grain weight compared to early drought treatments. Drought affected yield
mainly by reducing panicle and grain number, effects on grain weight were small. . Relieving early drought
through late irrigation led to more late tillers, more panicles, heavier grains, and later maturity. Full and
late drought increased screenings.

	This paper reports the development of a model to predict leaf appearance rate in oats (Avena sativa L.) based on the results of two field experiments and including a comparison of air and near-apex soil temperatures as predictors of leaf appearance. Oat genotype C&F 435 was sown on eight dates from April 1996 to November 1997. Nitrogen treatments (0 and 100 kg N/ha) were applied to the May and November 1997 crops. Observation of the number of visible leaf tips and leaf lamina length were taken at 2-7 day intervals. Near apex soil temperature and air temperature were recorded by data loggers. The number of visible tips was linearly related to temperature expressed as accumulated thermal time (base temperature of 0 degreesC). The rate of leaf appearance in thermal time, using either air or soil temperature, was nearly constant within a sowing date, but faster for spring sown than for autumn sown crops. Differences in this rate were less among sowing dates when near apex soil temperature was used to calculate thermal time than when screen temperatures were used. This indicated that the use of temperature near the shoot apex may improve phenological predictions from crop models. Nitrogen application had no effect on the rate of leaf appearance regardless of sowing date, but caused an average increase of 19% (P < 0.05) in the final leaf lamina length for the last five leaves.

Sonego, M., et al. (1997). Phenological development of oat crops in response to sowing dates. Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh Annual Conference of the Agronomy Society of New Zealand. 27: 115-118.
	Observations of apical development in oats were made from sowings made on six occasions through an annual cycle. These were analysed to determine the effects of temperature and daylength on the duration of the period from sowing until anthesis. A simple, two-phase thermal time accumulation model, modified by daylength in the post emergence phase, accounted for most of the variation (n = 6, CV = 6%).

Zhao, G. Q., et al. (2009). "Response of Nitrogen Uptake and Partitioning to Critical Nitrogen Supply in Oat Cultivars." Crop Science 49(3): 1040-1048.
	Nitrogen uptake and partitioning in oat (Avena sativa L.) are not well documented. A greenhouse study was conducted to determine the critical timing of N supply on the growth, N uptake, and partitioning. Plants grown in plastic pots were subjected to five N fertilization regimes: (i) control, N supply from seedling to physiological maturity (PM); (ii) N supply from seedling to flag leaf; (iii) N supply from flag leaf to PM; (iv) N supply from seedling to heading; and (v) N supply from heading to PM. Leaf chlorophyll content, plant dry matter (DM), and N uptake and accumulation were measured. Total plant DM was 21% greater for naked 'VAO-2' than for covered 'Prescott', while both genotypes produced similar grain yields. Varietal differences in total plant N were significant (P < 0.05) with average of 18% higher N content for VAO-2, but most of its accumulated N was in the vegetative components. For both varieties, N supply was more critical before heading than thereafter. Compared with the control, restriction of N supply from seedling to flag leaf stage significantly reduced spikelet number (28%) and grain yield (26%). Withholding N supply until heading reduced yield by up to 65% and N uptake by 75%. No yield reduction occurred when N was withheld from flag leaf or heading to PM. Although naked VAO-2 accumulated more N than Prescott under the same conditions, partitioning of N to the grain in VAO-2 was less efficient.

            <MemoText><![CDATA[An event driven method of calculating the final leaf number, Base on Martin et al 1998

Event  occurs when vegtative stage switches to Reproductive, either 4 or 6 leaf appearance.

If event occurs when PhotoPeriod is decreasing, then final leaf number is the MLN -2.


Otherwise

FLN = MLN - lc(PPS)

For Drummond these values  MLN = 17 and Lc = 0.56

THe model allows these to be cultivar deined.

# The APSIM Wheat Model

_Brown, H.E., Huth, N.I. and Holzworth, D.P._

The APSIM wheat model has been developed using the Plant Modelling Framework (PMF) of [brown_plant_2014]. This new framework provides a library of plant organ and process submodels that can be coupled, at runtime, to construct a model in much the same way that models can be coupled to construct a simulation. This means that dynamic composition of lower level process and organ classes (e.g. photosynthesis, leaf) into larger constructions (e.g. maize, wheat, sorghum) can be achieved by the model developer without additional coding.

The model consists of:

* a phenology model to simulate development between developmental phases  
* a structure model to simulate plant morphology  
* a collection of organs to simulate the various plant parts  
* an arbitrator to allocate resources (N, biomass) to the various plant organs

          <MemoText><![CDATA[Wheat exhibits a range of developmental responses to environment and these are strongly influences by genotype characteristics.
Temperature effects development increasing development rates and decreasing phase durations as temperatures increase.  Theset affects are captured by thermal time, .  However, wheat also exhibits vernalisation and photoperiod sensitivities in its Vegetative phase and further photoperiod sensitivity in the EarlyReproducivePhase.  Photoperiod responses are seen as a reduction in the length of a phase for a photoperiod sensitive genotype in response to a longer photoperiod.  Vernalisation responses are more complicated as they are driven by temperature but interact with photoperiod.  For vernalisation sensitive varieties (Winter types) exposure to cool temperatures or short photoperiods during the Vegetative phase will reduce the thermal time duration of the vegetative phase.  

We draw on the Kirby Framework to capture these vernalisation and photoperiod responses.  This framework assumes that the timing of anthesis is a result of the timing of flag leaf and an additional thermal time passage from there to anthesis.  It also assumes the timing of flag leaf is a result of the Final Leaf Number which sets a target, and leaf appearance rate, which sets the rate of progress toward this target.  Leaf appearance rate is a function of Thermal time and a genotype specific Phyllochron which changes with Haun stage as described by [Jamieson_LeafAppearance_1995].    

Final Leaf Number (FLN) is modeled as the sum of three numbers:

FLN = MinLeafNumber + VernalLeaves + PhotoLeaves

Where MinLeafNumber is the number of leaves that a wheat crop will produce when vernalisation is satisified early in the crops duration (before 2nd true leaf) and it is grown in a long photoperiod..  VernalLeaves are the number of leaves that are added due to vernalisation effects.  For insensitive varieties this will always be zero but this is potentially a larger number for sensitivie varieties and the number progresively decreases as the crop encounters more vernalisation.  PhotoLeaves are the number of leaves that are added to the minimum leaf number as a result of short day exposure.  For insensitive varieties this will be zero but is potential larger for more sensitivie varieties and decreases as day length increases.  More detailed explinations of the components of phenology are provided below.]]></MemoText>

      <MemoText><![CDATA[A test dataset has been developed to test the APSIM Oats model for a range of environmental (soil and climate) conditions, management options (sowing dates, populations, nitrogen rates, row spacing, irrigation), genetic backgrounds (different regions, cultivar types) and for special considerations such as crop damage.  These tests have been groups into various geographical regions to allow the user to evaluate the suitability of the model for their particular region of interest.  Graphs of model performance are provided for yield, biomass production, canopy development, phenological development, water and nitrogen uptake, and grain yield components.

Hobart.
	The response of oats (Avena sativa L.) to timing and intensity of drought was determined in a mobile
rainshelter, which excluded rainfall during crop growth. Ten irrigation treatments subjected the crops to
drought of varying duration at different stages during plant growth; the crops were otherwise fully
irrigated. Oat grain yield generally increased linearly with cumulative water use, and decreased linearly as
the maximum potential soil moisture deficit experienced during crop growth increased, regardless of the
timing of drought. The exception to this was the no drought (fully irrigated) treatment, where lodging
reduced panicle number and grain weight compared to early drought treatments. Drought affected yield
mainly by reducing panicle and grain number, effects on grain weight were small. . Relieving early drought
through late irrigation led to more late tillers, more panicles, heavier grains, and later maturity. Full and
late drought increased screenings.

Grazing winter forage crops is an important management strategy for profitable livestock production in many New Zealand regions where there is commonly a pasture feed deficit during this period. However, the high stocking densities that are often associated with these systems can have negative environmental effects, such as nitrogen (N) leaching losses to groundwater. This field study investigated the potential biomass production and reduced risk of N leaching from establishing oats (Avena sativa L.) as a green-chop catch crop after winter-grazed forage kale (Brassica oleracea var. acephala L.) in Canterbury, New Zealand. Oat crops were direct-drilled on two sowing dates (early: 1 July 2015 and late: 1 August 2015) and were managed under high (400 kg N/ha) and low (0 kg N/ha) N load conditions, representing urine-patch and inter urine-patch areas. For the early-sown crops yields were 6.1 (low N) and 11.8 t DM/ha (high N) at final harvest (50% ear emergence) on 19 November
2015. For the late-sown crops yields were 6.7 (low N) and 10.1 t DM/ha (high N) at the same development stage (26 November 2015). By establishing oats as a catch crop in winter soil profile mineral-N (0-120 cm depth) was reduced by up to 86% (early) and 80% (late) in the high N (simulated urine-patch) treatments compared with the respective fallow treatment. These results indicated the technical feasibility of direct drilling oats as catch crops immediately after winter forage grazing, with likely production and environmental benefits such as the reduced risk of N leaching losses.

Grazing winter forage crops is an important management strategy for profitable livestock production in many New Zealand regions where there is commonly a pasture feed deficit during this period. However, the high stocking densities that are often associated with these systems can have negative environmental effects, such as nitrogen (N) leaching losses to groundwater. This field study investigated the potential biomass production and reduced risk of N leaching from establishing oats (Avena sativa L.) as a green-chop catch crop after winter-grazed forage kale (Brassica oleracea var. acephala L.) in Canterbury, New Zealand. Oat crops were direct-drilled on two sowing dates (early: 1 July 2015 and late: 1 August 2015) and were managed under high (400 kg N/ha) and low (0 kg N/ha) N load conditions, representing urine-patch and inter urine-patch areas. For the early-sown crops yields were 6.1 (low N) and 11.8 t DM/ha (high N) at final harvest (50% ear emergence) on 19 November
2015. For the late-sown crops yields were 6.7 (low N) and 10.1 t DM/ha (high N) at the same development stage (26 November 2015). By establishing oats as a catch crop in winter soil profile mineral-N (0-120 cm depth) was reduced by up to 86% (early) and 80% (late) in the high N (simulated urine-patch) treatments compared with the respective fallow treatment. These results indicated the technical feasibility of direct drilling oats as catch crops immediately after winter forage grazing, with likely production and environmental benefits such as the reduced risk of N leaching losses.

Hobart.
	The response of oats (Avena sativa L.) to timing and intensity of drought was determined in a mobile
rainshelter, which excluded rainfall during crop growth. Ten irrigation treatments subjected the crops to
drought of varying duration at different stages during plant growth; the crops were otherwise fully
irrigated. Oat grain yield generally increased linearly with cumulative water use, and decreased linearly as
the maximum potential soil moisture deficit experienced during crop growth increased, regardless of the
timing of drought. The exception to this was the no drought (fully irrigated) treatment, where lodging
reduced panicle number and grain weight compared to early drought treatments. Drought affected yield
mainly by reducing panicle and grain number, effects on grain weight were small. . Relieving early drought
through late irrigation led to more late tillers, more panicles, heavier grains, and later maturity. Full and
late drought increased screenings.

Hobart.
	The response of oats (Avena sativa L.) to timing and intensity of drought was determined in a mobile
rainshelter, which excluded rainfall during crop growth. Ten irrigation treatments subjected the crops to
drought of varying duration at different stages during plant growth; the crops were otherwise fully
irrigated. Oat grain yield generally increased linearly with cumulative water use, and decreased linearly as
the maximum potential soil moisture deficit experienced during crop growth increased, regardless of the
timing of drought. The exception to this was the no drought (fully irrigated) treatment, where lodging
reduced panicle number and grain weight compared to early drought treatments. Drought affected yield
mainly by reducing panicle and grain number, effects on grain weight were small. . Relieving early drought
through late irrigation led to more late tillers, more panicles, heavier grains, and later maturity. Full and
late drought increased screenings.

Hobart.
	The response of oats (Avena sativa L.) to timing and intensity of drought was determined in a mobile
rainshelter, which excluded rainfall during crop growth. Ten irrigation treatments subjected the crops to
drought of varying duration at different stages during plant growth; the crops were otherwise fully
irrigated. Oat grain yield generally increased linearly with cumulative water use, and decreased linearly as
the maximum potential soil moisture deficit experienced during crop growth increased, regardless of the
timing of drought. The exception to this was the no drought (fully irrigated) treatment, where lodging
reduced panicle number and grain weight compared to early drought treatments. Drought affected yield
mainly by reducing panicle and grain number, effects on grain weight were small. . Relieving early drought
through late irrigation led to more late tillers, more panicles, heavier grains, and later maturity. Full and
late drought increased screenings.

Hobart.
	The response of oats (Avena sativa L.) to timing and intensity of drought was determined in a mobile
rainshelter, which excluded rainfall during crop growth. Ten irrigation treatments subjected the crops to
drought of varying duration at different stages during plant growth; the crops were otherwise fully
irrigated. Oat grain yield generally increased linearly with cumulative water use, and decreased linearly as
the maximum potential soil moisture deficit experienced during crop growth increased, regardless of the
timing of drought. The exception to this was the no drought (fully irrigated) treatment, where lodging
reduced panicle number and grain weight compared to early drought treatments. Drought affected yield
mainly by reducing panicle and grain number, effects on grain weight were small. . Relieving early drought
through late irrigation led to more late tillers, more panicles, heavier grains, and later maturity. Full and
late drought increased screenings.

Hobart.
	The response of oats (Avena sativa L.) to timing and intensity of drought was determined in a mobile
rainshelter, which excluded rainfall during crop growth. Ten irrigation treatments subjected the crops to
drought of varying duration at different stages during plant growth; the crops were otherwise fully
irrigated. Oat grain yield generally increased linearly with cumulative water use, and decreased linearly as
the maximum potential soil moisture deficit experienced during crop growth increased, regardless of the
timing of drought. The exception to this was the no drought (fully irrigated) treatment, where lodging
reduced panicle number and grain weight compared to early drought treatments. Drought affected yield
mainly by reducing panicle and grain number, effects on grain weight were small. . Relieving early drought
through late irrigation led to more late tillers, more panicles, heavier grains, and later maturity. Full and
late drought increased screenings.
