          "Text": "_Rogerio Cichota, AgResearch, New Zealand_\r\n\r\n\r\n##Preamble\r\nChicory (*Cichorium intybus* L.) is a perennial herb of the family Asteraceae native of Europe and Asia, but which can now be found in meadows worldwide ([Garnock-Jones_1987]; [HareEtAl_1990]; [AlloushEtAl_2003]; [LiKemp_2005]).  Two main varieties have been selected for agricultural uses, leaf chicory (var. *foliosum*), which has been cultivated for salads as well as a forage for livestock, and root chicory (var. *sativum*), grown for the taproots, which are used as a coffee substitute and more recently as dietary supplement ([DielenEtAl_2005]; [ErnstEtAl_1995]; [JurgonskiEtAl_2011]).  Wild varieties are considered a weed in many countries.  \r\nThe chicory plant has large shiny hairless leaves that grow from a basal rosette ([HareEtAl_1990]; [ErnstEtAl_1995]; [ReaumePanflet2010]), it has a thick deep taproot which holds carbohydrate reserves that allow prompt re-growth after winter or defoliation.  When vernalised, chicory will produce stems which contain several bright blue flowers, the stems become woody when flower buds start to appear.  Leaves do grow on stems but are quite small and decrease in size from the base to apex.  Flower buds form sequentially in the axils of the upper leaves of the main stem and branches.  Seeds reach maturity rapidly so the same plant will have young flowers and ripe seeds at the same time ([HareEtAl_1990]; [MoloneyMilne_1993]; [ClaphamEtAl_2001]; [ReaumePanflet2010]).  \r\nForage chicory is considered a moderately persistent herb under grazing conditions, its initial rosette can split into multiple crowns after the first growing season ([MoloneyMilne_1993]; [LiEtAl_1997c]; [ClaphamEtAl_2001]; [LiKemp_2005]).  Rapid establishment during spring/summer months provides a great competitive advantage for forage chicory over weeds, and it can be used as a monoculture or in mixed swards.  Chicory has shown resilience and potential to produce high yields at a wide range of management strategies ([ClarkEtAl_1990a]; [JungEtAl_1996]; [LiEtAl_1997b]; [LabreveuxEtAl_2004]), and is highly palatable to ruminants ([ClarkEtAl_1990b]; [JungEtAl_1996]).  The palatability of forage chicory will lead to preferential grazing and result in a competitive disadvantage for chicory in mixed swards, compromising its persistence.  Although it is classified as a perennial plant, the population in a chicory sward will decrease over time due to a variety of reasons, such as disease, selective grazing, and physical damage by trampling.  \r\n\r\n\r\n**Objective:**  The model presented here has been built using the Plant Modelling Framework (PMF) of [brown_plant_2014] to simulate the growth of a forage chicory crop.  Currently, the focus is mainly on describing biomass accumulation and regrowth after harvest on monocultural swards.  As part of APSIM's PMF, using chicory for multicropping is possible, but this has not been fully tested.  Likewise, describing the effect of population decrease on plant growth was not attempted; for swards free of weeds and within typical population ranges, the changes in plant size (number of crowns) and LAI should compensate for loss of population (e.g. [LiEtAl_1997b]), but competition with weeds would alter this pattern significantly.  \r\nSimulating variations in plant N concentration (seasonal or due to changes in soil status)  is not a focus of the current model.  Further development of PMF's supply/demand processes are needed for capturing the variations in N content typically seen in perennial species.  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Generic background  \r\n",

The chicory model focus, thus, on describing primarily the vegetative growth, with a simplified account of the reproductive phase, without explicit considering flowers and seeds (these may be included in future releases).  The model was built using the Plant Modelling Framework (PMF) described by [brown_plant_2014].  To simulate the aboveground plant structure, including the photosynthesis process, the Chicory model uses the SimpleLeaf organ type of PMF.  The model describes a semi-perennial crop, with phenology rewinding to the vegetative stage at the end of the reproductive phase.\n\n\n# Inclusion in APSIM simulations\nA forage chicory crop can be included in a simulation the same as any other APSIM crop.\n\n  - The chicory object can be dragged or copied from the Crop folder in the tool box into a Field in your simulation;\n  - To become active, chicory needs to be sown using a manager script with a sowing rule. e.g.:\n~~~\n  Chicory.Sow(cultivar: Puna, population: 200, depth: 10, rowSpacing: 150);  \n~~~\nIf a specified cultivar is not available, a fatal error will be thrown.\n\n\n## Harvest and biomass removal\nChicory biomass can be removed by raising one of the valid methods: Harvest, Cut, Graze, or Prune; this is done using a manager script, like for other crops.  The proportion of the biomass of each organ that is removed from the system and/or added to the residue pools may be specified; otherwise defaults will be used.  Note that the sum of fractions removed and added to residue should be <= 1.0.  To specify the proportions for removal in a manager script, use a RemovalFractions class as shown below:\n~~~\n[EventSubscribe(\"Commencing\")]  \nprivate void OnSimulationCommencing(object sender, EventArgs e)  \n{  \n  RemoveFraction = new RemovalFractions(Chicory.Organs);  \n}  \n[EventSubscribe(\"DoManagement\")]    \nprivate void OnDoManagement(object sender, EventArgs e)  \n{  \n  if (Clock.Today.Date == HarvestDate)  \n  {  \n    RemoveFraction.SetFractionToRemove(\"Leaf\", 0.80);  \n    RemoveFraction.SetFractionToRemove(\"Stem\", 0.50);  \n    RemoveFraction.SetFractionToResidue(\"leaf\",0.05);\n    Chicory.Harvest(RemoveFraction);  \n  }\n}  \n~~~\nThe RemovalFractions class can be sent with Harvest, Cut, Graze, or Prune events. All parameters are optional, defaults are used whenever any value is not specified.\n\n\n## Crop termination\nTo fully terminate a crop the EndCrop event should be raised:\n~~~\n  Chicory.EndCrop();  \n~~~\nOnce a crop has been ended the field is open to be used by another APSIM plant model, or another chicory crop.  Note that ending chicory is not necessary before sowing another crop, competition for resources will take place between crops when there is more than one in the field.  \n\n\n# Acknowledgements\nThis model was developed with help from Russel McAuliffe and Brittany Paton organising data and simulations. Datasets were kindly shared by Julia M. Lee, Hamish E. Brown, and the Forages for Reduced Nitrogen Leaching (FRNL) programme.\n",

                  "Text": "Vernalisation is the process whereby the plant acquires the ability to go into reproductive phase after been exposed to a period of time at low temperatures ([Wiebe_1990]; [DemeulemeesterEtAl_1998]). For chicory the temperature range for vernalisation is between 0 and 12oC, with optimum about 4-6oC ([Wiebe_1989]; [Wiebe_1990]; [Gianquinto_1997]; [DielenEtAl_2005]).  \n        The reversal of vernalisation, or de-vernalisation, can happen on chicory ([Wiebe_1990]; [Gianquinto_1997]), if plants are exposed to sufficiently high temperatures soon after the period under vernalisation the effects of vernalisation are cancelled out. Most plants show small reversal at relatively lower temperatures (above something in between 15 and 20oC), and larger at temperatures above 30oC. For chicory, the more effective temperature to reverse vernalisation seem to be around 30-35oC ([Gianquinto_1997]; [GoodgerThesis_2013]). Intermediate temperatures stabilise the vernalisation, and after 5-10 days reversal is no longer possible.  \n        The number of days required for full vernalisation is quite variable in chicory and specific to each cultivar, with 30-50 days often given for full vernalisation ([Wiebe_1990]; [Gianquinto_1997]; [DielenEtAl_2005]). However, some plants of leafy cultivars can go into reproductive phase if exposed to cold conditions for about a week or less ([Gianquinto_1997]). For forage chicory (cv. Puna) at field conditions in the USA, about 50-60% of the plants reached reproductive stage after winter ([ClaphamEtAl_2001]; [SandersonEtAl_2003]), and plants that bolted on one year tended to remain vegetative the following year and vice-versa. In New Zealand conditions, reproductive phase seems to occur every year after winter ([HareEtAl_1990]), although the extent of it has not been reported. The data published suggest a minimum number of days for vernalisation (approximately 10 days) and a progressive increase in the number of plants vernalised as the number of days the plants are kept under cold conditions increases. This is simulated by the model by assuming that the change in biomass fixation during stem elongation and reproductive phases (prioritising stems and flowers) is a function of vernalisation.  ",

The phase start initially after emergence, but it is also re-called after the end of the reproductive phase (phenology reset).

Root cultivars have an absolute need for vernalisation and also seem to require a certain age to be able to be vernalised, whereas leaf cultivars can be vernalised at any age ([Gianquinto_1997]; [Schittenhelm_2001]).  Forage chicory seem to be in between these two extremes, with reports that at least some vernalisation is required ([HareEtAl_1990]; [MoloneyMilne_1993]). \n        The chicory model considers that a minimum vernalisation is needed, but this is quite small (mostly based on data from [Gianquinto_1997]). Vernalisation will have a greater effect on the extent of stem and flowers growth ([Wiebe_1989]; [Gianquinto_1997]; [DielenEtAl_2005]), and thus vernalisation accumulation is considered throughout the inductive phase.",

This can prompt growth especially at the end of winter and following defoliation.  To mimic this process, the chicory model can use the non-structural fraction of taproots' biomass to complement demand for new growth; this is done via biomass retranslocation.  There is a considerable amount of information about the build up of reserves in roots of chicory, although most of it is for root cultivars, some developed specifically for high sugar content in roots ().  Mono- and di-saccharides (fructose and sucrose) and especilly fructans (inulin) reserves build up over the growing season in the taproot and their content can reach 60-80% of dry mater before winter ([AmezianeEtAl_1995]; [ErnstEtAl_1995]; [DemeulemeesterEtAl_1998]; [MontiEtAl_2005]).  This content is much lower for leaf varieties, reaching 20-30% ([LiEtAl_1997a]; [ErnstEtAl_1995];  [QuijadaThesis_2015]), and this can be further reduced if defoliation is severe or the plants have bolted ([Arias-carbajalThesis_1994]; [LiEtAl_1997a]; [Schittenhelm_2001]; [CranstonEtAl_2016]).  Build up of N reserves (as proteins and amino-acids) in taproots has also been show to occur at the end of growing season, and then being used for shoot development after winter ([LimamiEtAl_1996]; [BewleyDerek_2002]).  The controls for the build up of reserves of the rate that they can be used for new growth are still mostly unknown.  Defoliation and environmental stress (drought) have been shown to reduce the reserves ([LiEtAl_1997a], [MontiEtAl_2005]), but it is not clear whether this is a direct affect or due to the greater usage of reserves to cope with the stresses.  \n      For the chicory model the set of parameters related to the storage of reserves and their utilisation (StructuralFraction, DMRetranslocationFactor, and NRetranslocationFactor) were manipulated in order to reflect the trends shown in the literature review and attempting to reproduce the results of the available experimental datasets (used in the validation tests).  These should be upgraded when data more specific to the retranslocation process is made available. ",

              "Text": "The target shoot:root ratio is used by the chicory model to ensure prompt regrowth after a defoliation event.   The model will change the allocation of new growth attempting to keep a balance in organ biomass distribution. This is a simplified approach to biomass allocation plasticity (e.g. [Wilson_1988]; [LevangBrilz_2002]), it assumes that the plant adjusts the allocation biomass whenever the current shoot:root ratio differs from the target value.  \n      Estimated values for the shoot:root ratio of chicory based on published data vary considerably and are linked to cultivar (e.g. [LiEtAl_1997a]; [ZagalEtAl_2001]; [BeleskyEtAl_2004]).  Varieties bred for root harvesting can have shoot:root ratios al low as 1.0 whereas for leaf cultivars the values may be up to around 5.0.  Data for forage chicory suggest values around 2.0 for adult plants ([LiEtAl_1997a]; [LabreveuxThesis_2002]; [AlloushEtAl_2003]; [CranstonEtAl_2015]).  This value is likely to be affected by environmental conditions, with water or nutrient deficit causing a shift towards root growth, while leaf growth is favoured during low light conditions.  However, these relationships can vary considerably in different plants or cultivars and little data is available for forage chicory.  The model currently does not account fort the influence of environmental factors on the shoot:root partition, but it does account for vernalisation.  \n      Stem elongation, or bolting, only occurs when chicory is vernalised and it has been shown happen in only a fraction of the plants in a sward each year ([ClaphamEtAl_2001]; [SandersonEtAl_2003]; [DielenEtAl_2005]).  This variation seems to be linked to the extent of vernalisation ([Gianquinto_1997]; [DielenEtAl_2005]).  Thus, to account for the growth of both bolting and non-bolting plants, the chicory model assumes that the changes in biomass allocation are a function of vernalisation as well as phenological phase.

              "Text": "The chicory model will change the allocation of biomass above ground attempting to keep a given proportion among the various organs.  The allocation of biomass to leaves is defined primarily by the target shoo:root ratio, but during the stem elongation and reproductive phases, the partition is modified favouring stems and inflorescence.  This is controlled by the target ratio of stems+inflorescence to leaves. This ratio may be affected by defoliation ([ClarkEtAl_1990a]; [LiEtAl_1994]; [QuijadaThesis_2015]) and is probably affected by enviromental factors too. There is not enough data to describe these interactions.  \n      The allocation of biomass to stems is difficult to inferr because there are many confounding issues, such as growth stage, vernalisation level, graze intensity, etc.  Under lax grazing conditions and after some vernalisation, stem fraction is about 25-50%, but can be as high as 70%, values around 15-25% are reported for intensive grazing ([ClarkEtAl_1990b]; [LiEtAl_1994]; [JungEtAl_1996]; [LiEtAl_1997a]; [LiEtAl_1997c]).  The Stem:leaf ratio is thus between 0.25 and 1.0 for grazed plants.\n      Bolting only occur in a fraction of plant each year, around 50% ([ClaphamEtAl_2001]; [SandersonEtAl_2003]; [DielenEtAl_2005]). So, as a compromise, it assumed in the chicory model that the stem:leaf ratio increases sharply at the beginning of the stem elongation phase, reaching a maximum value and then is constant until near the end of flowering when if decreases again.  This maximum should be not too high to account for non bolting plants.  ",
