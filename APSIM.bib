   abstract = {In New Zealand and worldwide, growers are increasingly being required to demonstrate that their nutrient management does not have adverse effects on the environment. Since routine direct measurements of nitrogen (N) losses at an appropriate scale are currently unfeasible, a modelling tool that can be used to assess losses, both actual and potential, from farming systems is therefore needed. We present the upgraded N balance module for cropping systems (OVCrop) developed to be incorporated into the OVERSEER<sup>«</sup> Nutrient Budgets model. It presents an easy-to-use interface, requiring few but meaningful inputs, with the minimum flexibility needed to describe management of real farming systems. Following the developmental guidelines of OVERSEER<sup>«</sup> Nutrient Budget, OVCrop is designed to provide the long-term annual average of N leaching from any user-defined cropping rotation. OVCrop has been parameterized based on process-based model simulations for typical farm systems and environments of New Zealand. The intended use of the OVCrop is to help on-farm nutrient management and to demonstrate future compliance to N leaching regulations. OVCrop is a robust tool, simple enough to be used by people with a low to medium level of expertise, such as farmers and regional councils.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Plant Modelling Framework (PMF) is a software framework for creating models that represent the plant components of farm system models in the agricultural production system simulator (APSIM). It is the next step in the evolution of generic crop templates for APSIM, building on software and science lessons from past versions and capitalising on new software approaches. The PMF contains a top-level Plant class that provides an interface with the APSIM model environment and controls the other classes in the plant model. Other classes include mid-level Organ, Phenology, Structure and Arbitrator classes that represent specific elements or processes of the crop and sub-classes that the mid-level classes use to represent repeated data structures. It also contains low-level Function classes which represent generic mathematical, logical, procedural or reference code and provide values to the processes carried out by mid-level classes. A plant configuration file specifies which mid-level and Function classes are to be included and how they are to be arranged and parameterised to represent a particular crop model. The PMF has an integrated design environment to allow plant models to be created visually. The aims of the PMF are to maximise code reuse and allow flexibility in the structure of models. Four examples are included to demonstrate the flexibility of application of the PMF; 1. Slurp, a simple model of the water use of a static crop, 2. Oat, an annual grain crop model with detailed growth, development and resource use processes, 3. Lucerne, perennial forage model with detailed growth, development and resource use processes, 4. Wheat, another detailed annual crop model constructed using an alternative set of organ and process classes. These examples show the PMF can be used to develop models of different complexities and allows flexibility in the approach for implementing crop physiology concepts into model set up.},

Agricultural systems models are regularly employed in studying sustainable crop management but no detailed model is currently available for oil palm systems. We developed a production systems model for oil palm within the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) framework and tested it using data across a range of environments within Papua New Guinea (PNG). The model captured key growth responses to climate and management. This demonstrates that modern modelling frameworks do allow for rapid model development for new agricultural systems. However, whilst application of the model is promising, the availability of key data is likely to restrict its use. Local soil and weather data are not available in adequate detail for many of the major oil palm production areas, although some methods exist to address this.},

APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator) is one such model that continues to be applied and adapted to this challenging research agenda.

Keating et al. (2003) described many of the fundamental attributes of APSIM in detail. Much has changed in the last decade, and the APSIM community has been exploring novel scientific domains and utilising software developments in social media, web and mobile applications to provide simulation tools adapted to new demands.

This paper updates the earlier work by Keating et al. (2003) and chronicles the changing external challenges and opportunities being placed on APSIM during the last decade. It also explores and discusses how APSIM has been evolving to a “next generation” framework with improved features and capabilities that allow its use in many diverse topics.},

   abstract = {A more-efficient use of resources is a major reason advanced for the advantage of intercropping over alternative cropping systems. This paper reviews the interception and utilization of solar radiation in intercropping systems. To achieve this, a framework is presented on radiation interception and use in sole crops and elements of this framework are subsequently extended to intercropping systems. Improved productivity per unit incident radiation could be achieved by the adoption of an intercropping system that either increases the interception of solar radiation and/or has greater radiation-use efficiency. Minimizing the proportion of radiant energy reaching the ground is a simple means of promoting efficient utilization of incident solar radiation. Examples are discussed where advantages acrued from intercropping short- and long-duration species due to enhanced radiation capture over time. Frequent confounding with plant density effects has meant that the evidence for intercropping to enhance radiation capture in space is equivocal. Examples are also presented, demonstrating improved utilization of radiant energy, once intercepted, either by more-efficient production of biomass or increased proportion of biomass partitioned to yield. The potential variety and complexity of intercropping systems, means that recommendations on how to optimise radiation capture and use in intercrops could not readily be determined. Attempts to quantify and predict intercrop performance are examined and dynamic simulation models considered to offer a means by which intercrop performance could be optimised.},

The CERES-Maize model did not accurately predict grain-yield of cultivar Dekalb XL82 which was grown over a range of sowing dates and water regimes at Katherine, N.T. Experimental yields (at 15.5% moisture) ranged from 0 to 9840 kg ha−1. Calibration of CERES-Maize reduced the root mean square deviation (rmsd) for observed grain-yields from 3480 to 2015 kg ha−1. Functions describing phenology, leaf growth and senescence, assimilate production and grain growth were revised and validated against field data. The revisions to CERES-Maize not only provide a model more applicable to the semi-arid tropics but also identify the parameters that may require calibration for other maize genotypes and locations in this climatic zone. Further validations of the functions describing nitrogen cycling and rainfall infiltration and runoff are required to increase the model's applicability to risk-analysis studies.},

   abstract = {The Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator, APSIM, is a cropping system modelling environment that simulates the dynamics of soil-plant-management interactions within a single crop or a cropping system. Adaptation of previously developed crop models has resulted in multiple crop modules in APSIM, which have low scientific transparency and code efficiency. A generic crop model template (GCROP) has been developed to capture unifying physiological principles across crops (plant types) and to provide modular and efficient code for crop modelling. It comprises a standard crop interface to the APSIM engine, a generic crop model structure, a crop process library, and well-structured crop parameter files. The process library contains the major science underpinning the crop models and incorporates generic routines based on physiological principles for growth and development processes that are common across crops. It allows APSIM to simulate different crops using the same set of computer code. The generic model structure and parameter files provide an easy way to test, modify, exchange and compare modelling approaches at process level without necessitating changes in the code. The standard interface generalises the model inputs and outputs, and utilises a standard protocol to communicate with other APSIM modules through the APSIM engine. The crop template serves as a convenient means to test new insights and compare approaches to component modelling, while maintaining a focus on predictive capability. This paper describes and discusses the scientific basis, the design, implementation and future development of the crop template in APSIM. On this basis, we argue that the combination of good software engineering with sound crop science can enhance the rate of advance in crop modelling.},

abstract = {Tillering is an important adaptive feature of pearl millet (Pennisetum americanum L.) to the unpredictable growing conditions of dry areas of the semi-arid tropics. Yet, this feature has largely been ignored in the development of simulation models for pearl millet. The objective of this paper is to parameterise and validate a leaf area module for pearl millet, which dynamically simulates crop leaf area from the leaf area of individual axes through simulating inter-axis competition for light. To derive parameters for the model, four cultivars (contrasting in phenology and tillering habit) were grown under well-watered and well-fertilised conditions across a range of plant densities in three experiments at two locations in India. For selected plants, observations on the number of primary basal tillers and on the number of visible, fully expanded, and senesced leaves on each axis were made twice a week throughout the growing season. Occurrence of panicle initiation (PI) was observed in two experiments only, but data were complemented by published and unpublished data, obtained for comparable cultivars. Parameters were obtained for the time from emergence to \{PI\} as a function of daylength, the leaf initiation rate, the rate of leaf and tiller appearance and the leaf senescence rate; parameters for leaf size were determined in a previous paper. Our parameter estimates compared well with published data and were, with the exception of time to \{PI\} and leaf size, mostly independent of cultivar, axis and density. Genotypic effects on productive tiller number could be attributed to differences in main shoot leaf size. Validation of the leaf area module showed that the module adequately reproduced the effects of density, photoperiod and genotype on the leaf area of individual axes and on productive tiller number. This was despite the fact that the reduction in leaf area of non-productive tillers was achieved in the module through a reduction in leaf size, whereas the crop reduced leaf area through a reduction in leaf number. Our results indicate that \{LAI\} of a tillering crop can be simulated adequately by simulating \{LAI\} from individual leaf area and incorporating the effects of competition for light. }

   abstract = {Background The Ethiopian cereal teff (Eragrostis tef (Zuccagni) Trotter), traditionally grown under short days (11–13 h) (SD), is currently introduced into NW Europe where the early phases of the growing season are characterized by long days (15–17 h) (LD). This paper analyzes to what degree teff's ontogeny and morphology are day length sensitive. Methods To analyze the day length response of teff considering panicle initiation, time to heading, number of phytomers, plant height and biomass, growth chamber and greenhouse experiments were conducted. In these experiments two Ethiopian cultivars, Gibe and Ziquala, and two cultivars from a Dutch breeding programme, Ayana and 04T19, were exposed to day lengths of 9, 10.5, 12, 13.5, 15, 16.5 and 18 h. Key results The Ethiopian cultivars of teff showed a stronger photoperiod response than the Dutch cultivars. For example, time to heading for Ziquala was 88 d under LD but 37 d under SD whereas for Ayana it was 45 d under LD and 29 d under SD. Time to heading could be described using a smooth logistic function consisting of four biologically interpretable parameters. Application of the same function to literature data of the short day plants: rice (Oryza sativa) and soya bean (Glycine max), and the long day plants: wheat (Triticum aestivum) and wild oat (Avena fatua) showed the broader applicability of the approach. Not only panicle initiation of teff, but also development and outgrowth of the panicle were influenced by photoperiod. Plant-to-plant variation in time to heading, the total number of phytomers per shoot, the number of elongated internodes and biomass were higher in LD than in SD treatments for all cultivars. Conclusions This paper provides a detailed description and quantification of the response of teff to day length. The smooth logistic function presented is applicable not only for teff, but also for other short day (rice and soya bean) and long day (wheat and wild oat) species. We revealed, moreover, genetic variation in day length sensitivity, including a strain that showed almost day length neutral behaviour. The ample genetic variation between cultivars suggests there is a basis for breeding for high yielding cultivars for the northern latitudes.},

Traditional methods of soil moisture monitoring have been employed with some success but limitations in utilising them efficiently across both time and space have led to restrictions in their use. An electromagnetic induction (EMI) technique has been evaluated and used to study the patterns of soil water extraction from a Grey Vertosol in fallow or cropped fields alongside a Eucalyptus argophloia windbreak near Warra, Qld (26.93°S, 150.93°E). This technique provides methods for minimising error caused by seasonal variations in temperature and the vertical distributions of both soil water and temperature. The calibration developed in this study was successful in describing the observed variations in total soil moisture in the surface 0.9 m of the soil profile (R2 = 0.93, s.e. = 15.3 mm). We conclude that EMI techniques can provide a quick and efficient means for monitoring soil moisture patterns in agroforestry systems when employed under suitable conditions. This paper describes the techniques developed and where they may be employed, the type of information available from the approach, and the likely methods for employing EMI approaches in a wider range of situations.},

In the medium to low rainfall zones, these plantings can negatively impact upon adjacent agricultural production through competition for soil moisture. The nature of the tree-crop competition zone and the means of managing it have been studied in the main southern cropping zones. However, the differences in soil, climate and agronomic systems in Australia's northern dryland cropping zones could lead to differences in the competition processes and the management options needed to minimise them. In this study, the competition for soil moisture and resultant impacts on crop production were studied for a Eucalyptus argophloia windbreak on a farm near Warra, Queensland (26.938 degrees S, 150.938 degrees E). The results indicate well defined inner and outer competition zones, the extents of which agree with those found elsewhere in Australia and overseas. However, while the extent of the competition is comparable with other regions, local agronomic practices developed for variable climatic conditions and deep clay soils allow trees to extract soil water stored during fallow periods resulting in relatively higher production losses.},

   abstract = {A conceptual framework of the time course of soil water depletion under water limiting conditions was used to quantify water extraction by sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) on a wide range of soil types. The framework takes account of the maximum plant-available soil water content (MAWC) in each layer, the rate at which the soil water extraction front descends through the soil profile (EFV) and the rate of water extraction within each soil layer (kl). Total plant-available soil water for the profile (TPAW) is defined as the sum for all layers of the difference in volumetric soil water between the drained upper limit (theta(u), determined in a separate infiltration experiment) and the lower limit (theta(l), determined at the end of the experiment after water extraction by the crop). To quantify parameter values, soil water content was measured frequently in sunflower crops grown entirely on stored soil moisture. Measurements were made in an environment with high temperature and vapour pressure deficit to determine the potential rate of water extraction. The parameters theta(u), theta(l) and kl were determined for each 20-cm depth increment for each of five soil types. The rate of progression of the soil water extraction front through the profile (EFV) and time at which the extraction front commences its descent (t0) were also determined for each soil type. The framework described actual water extraction on each soil type well. Values for TPAW ranged from 77 to 210 mm for the five soils. This was a result of differences in maximum depth of extraction (EF(max)) and MAWC. Values for MAWC in the surface were related to clay content and were greatest (24%) at clay contents near 55%. On heavy textured soils, MAWC decreased linearly with depth whereas on soils low in clay content it did not change with depth. The decline was caused by an increase in theta(l) with depth. It is possible that preferred root pathways resulted in a lower than expected water extraction at depth and deeper soil layers were consequently not fully exploited. Therefore, values for TPAW are a combination of plant and soil factors. Maximum depth of water extraction (EF(max)) ranged from 80 to 180 cm. The potential EFV across soil types was 3.6 cm day-1. Values of EF(max) related to either crop factors (time to flowering) or soil factors (decline in MAWC). The extraction rate kl increased linearly with clay content of the soil profile. Cumulative water extraction varied among soil types depending on MAWC, EF(max) and kl.},

   abstract = {Integrating belts of woody perennials into Australian farms is proposed as a method of enhancing crop productivity through shelter benefits while addressing natural resource management issues including groundwater recharge. This paper presents yield data from cereal and pulse crops collected from windbreak sites through the eastern agricultural districts of South Australia, using a harvester equipped with a yield monitor. The crop response followed the expected pattern of a competition zone of reduced yield of 1&#x2013;4 tree heights (H) adjacent to the windbreak followed by a shelter benefit zone of unchanged or improved yield extending out to a maximum of 20H. The yield response in the sheltered benefit zone is +3.7% for all cereals (2.2H&#x2013;9.7H) and is +14.0% for all pulse crops (1.7H&#x2013;10.4H). Wheat and barley have similar results, with gains in the shelter benefit zones of 4.1% and 2.1%, respectively, with windbreak competition effects resulting in net yields of 3.0% for wheat and &#x2013;1.1% for barley in the sheltered zones. Faba bean (Vicia faba) shows a strong consistent response to wind shelter, with a yield increase of 19.6% in the shelter benefit zone (1.5H&#x2013;19.6H) and net gain of 19.1% in the sheltered zone (crop edge at 1.0H and extending to 19.6H). The response of cereals to sheltered effects varied across the years of the survey, with net positive results in 1997 (7.4%) and 1999 (7.5%) and close to zero in 1998 and 2000. A theoretical prediction of potential crop yield based on climate for the years of the survey showed that 1997 and 1999 had lower yield potential than 2000 and 1998. This suggests that the climatic conditions occurring during the growing season also influence crop shelter responses. Where cereals are the predominant crop the net yield returns from windbreaks would be small, even if root pruning could be successfully undertaken.},

   abstract = {Components of the water balance of an alley cropping system were measured to assess the extent to which tree rows 30 m apart with access to a fresh, perched watertable at 5 m depth were able to capture deep drainage from an inter-cropped cereal-legume rotation. Neutron probe data showed that the 4-year-old trees, cut back to 0.6-m high at the beginning of the experiment, depleted soil water to 2, 4, and 8 m laterally from the tree rows in their first, second, and third years of coppice regrowth, respectively. Combining data from soil water depletion in summer and comparisons of deuterium: hydrogen ratios of groundwater, xylem sap of trees, and herbaceous plants, it was shown that tagasaste trees drew on soil water for 80% of their transpiration in the first winter and 40% in the second, while switching to near total dependence on groundwater each summer and early autumn. Tree water use on a whole plot basis was 170 mm in 1997 (68% from groundwater) v. 167 mm in 1998 (73% from groundwater). Recharge to the perched watertable was estimated to be 193 mm under sole crop in 1998 (52% of rainfall), reducing to 32 mm when uptake of groundwater by trees was included. The degree of complementarity between tagasaste trees and crops in alley cropping used for water management is quantified for 1998 by calculating the ratio of the distance over which trees reduced drainage to zero to the distance over which they reduced crop yield to zero. It is concluded that segregated monocultures of trees and crops would be a more appropriate strategy than a closely integrated system such as alley cropping in this case.

   abstract = {Background and Aims A model to predict anthesis time of a wheat plant from environmental and genetic information requires integration of current concepts in physiological and molecular biology. This paper describes the structure of an integrated model and quantifies its response mechanisms. Methods Literature was reviewed to formulate the components of the model. Detailed re-analysis of physiological observations are utilized from a previous publication by the second two authors. In this approach measurements of leaf number and leaf and primordia appearance of near isogenic lines of spring and winter wheat grown for different durations in different temperature and photoperiod conditions are used to quantify mechanisms and parameters to predict time of anthesis. Key Results The model predicts the time of anthesis from the length of sequential phases: 1, embryo development; 2, dormant; 3, imbibed/emerging; 4, vegetative; 5, early reproductive; 6, pseudo-stem extension; and 7, ear development. Phase 4 ends with vernalization saturation (VS), Phase 5 with terminal spikelet (TS) and Phase 6 with flag leaf ligule appearance (FL). The durations of Phases 4 and 5 are linked to the expression of Vrn genes and are calculated in relation to change in Haun stage (HS) to account for the effects of temperature per se. Vrn1 must be expressed to sufficient levels for VS to occur. Vrn1 expression occurs at a base rate of 0.08/HS in winter 'Batten' and 0.17/HS in spring 'Batten' during Phases 1, 3 and 4. Low temperatures promote expression of Vrn1 and accelerate progress toward VS. Our hypothesis is that a repressor, Vrn4, must first be downregulated for this to occur. Rates of Vrn4 downregulation and Vrn1 upregulation have the same exponential response to temperature, but Vrn4 is quickly upregulated again at high temperatures, meaning short exposure to low temperature has no impact on the time of VS. VS occurs when Vrn1 reaches a relative expression of 0.76 and Vrn3 expression begins. However, Vrn2 represses Vrn3 expression so Vrn1 must be further upregulated to repress Vrn2 and enable Vrn3 expression. As a result, the target for Vrn1 to trigger VS was 0.76 in 8-h photoperiods (Pp) and increased at 0.026/HS under 16-h Pp as levels of Vrn2 increased. This provides a mechanism to model short-day vernalization. Vrn3 is expressed in Phase 5 (following VS), and apparent rates of Vrn3 expression increased from 0.15/HS at 8-h Pp to 0.33/HS at 16-h Pp. The final number of leaves is calculated as a function of the HS at which TS occurred (TS(HS)): 2.86 + 1.1 x TS(HS). The duration of Phase 6 is then dependent on the number of leaves left to emerge and how quickly they emerge. Conclusions The analysis integrates molecular biology and crop physiology concepts into a model framework that links different developmental genes to quantitative predictions of wheat anthesis time in different field situations.},

   abstract = {The Sirius wheat simulation model calculates biomass production from intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and grain growth from simple partitioning rules. Leaf area index (LAI) is developed from a thermal time submodel. Phenological development is calculated from the mainstem leaf appearance rate and final leaf number, with the latter determined by responses to daylength and vernalization. Effects of water and N deficits are calculated through their influences on LAI development and radiation use efficiency. The validation of the model using data from independent and near-independent experiments at Lincoln, New Zealand, and Rothamsted, UK, is described. Despite there being no calculation of tiller dynamics or grain number, the model accurately simulated the behaviour of crops exposed to a wide range of conditions. It is concluded that the accurate prediction of phenological development and LAI is much more important for grain yield prediction than are the components of yield. Although grain population is not a necessary step in yield calculation in Sirius, the model proved useful in investigating the effects of stress in setting grain number. The analysis showed that the influence of stress on partitioning of biomass to the spike during pre-anthesis spike growth was much more important in determining grain number than was the effect on biomass accumulation during the same phase.},
