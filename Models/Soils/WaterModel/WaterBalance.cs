    /// <summary>
    /// The SoilWater module is a cascading water balance model that owes much to its precursors in 
    /// CERES (Jones and Kiniry, 1986) and PERFECT(Littleboy et al, 1992). 
    /// The algorithms for redistribution of water throughout the soil profile have been inherited from 
    /// the CERES family of models.
    ///
    /// The water characteristics of the soil are specified in terms of the lower limit (ll15), 
    /// drained upper limit(dul) and saturated(sat) volumetric water contents. Water movement is 
    /// described using separate algorithms for saturated or unsaturated flow. It is notable that 
    /// redistribution of solutes, such as nitrate- and urea-N, is carried out in this module.
    ///
    /// Modifications adopted from PERFECT include:
    /// * the effects of surface residues and crop cover on modifying runoff and reducing potential soil evaporation,
    /// * small rainfall events are lost as first stage evaporation rather than by the slower process of second stage evaporation, and
    /// * specification of the second stage evaporation coefficient(cona) as an input parameter, providing more flexibility for describing differences in long term soil drying due to soil texture and environmental effects.
    ///
    /// The module is interfaced with SurfaceOrganicMatter and crop modules so that simulation of the soil water balance 
    /// responds to change in the status of surface residues and crop cover(via tillage, decomposition and crop growth).
    ///
    /// Enhancements beyond CERES and PERFECT include:
    /// * the specification of swcon for each layer, being the proportion of soil water above dul that drains in one day
    /// * isolation from the code of the coefficients determining diffusivity as a function of soil water
    ///   (used in calculating unsaturated flow).Choice of diffusivity coefficients more appropriate for soil type have been found to improve model performance.
    /// * unsaturated flow is permitted to move water between adjacent soil layers until some nominated gradient in 
    ///   soil water content is achieved, thereby accounting for the effect of gravity on the fully drained soil water profile.
    ///
    /// SoilWater is called by APSIM on a daily basis, and typical of such models, the various processes are calculated consecutively. 
    /// This contrasts with models such as SWIM that solve simultaneously a set of differential equations that describe the flow processes.
