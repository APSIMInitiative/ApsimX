It is a daily time step implementation of the crop model that is used on the Overseer nutrient balance model [Cichota_etal_2010].  It uses simple sigmoidal functions for estimating daily cover and biomass deltas to give realistic water and nitrogen demands. It does not simulate potential yield, this is specified as an input. Yield will be reduced below the specified potential yield if N or water supplies from the soil are insufficient to meet demand. The model has been paramaterised for simulating water and nitrogen balances of cropping rotations in New Zealand (where over 50 different crop types are grown and it is not feasible to produce full crop models for each of these).  Because of this the model is not as generically applicable as full APSIM crop models.   It may be adapted for other purposes and other crop types may be added but the user will need to keep in mind that because it is a simple model the the parameters might need changing for crops in different locations or for crops sown at different times of the year.  Some sensibility testing or validation is recommended before application in different sutuations.   SCRUM has a simple phenology model which divides the crop growth into three main phases; a vegetative phase when the canopy is expanding, a reproductive phase when product is being formed and a senescing phase when the canopy is contracting.  SCRUM has 4 organ classes to represent different biomass components and the real biomass components that these classes represent changes from crop to crop:     1. A Simple leaf class called <b>Stover</b> which represents the unharvested parts of the plant.  Generally, this represents the leaf and stem components of the crop but for crops where stem and leaf are part of the harvested product (e.g forages and leafy vegetables) than stover is the residual fraction of leaf and stem that is not harvested.     2. A Generic organ class called <b>Product</b> which represents the plant parts that are harvested and removed from the field.  This could represent grain, fruits, tubers, leaf or stem depending on what sort of crop is being represented.     3. A Root organ which extracts water and nitrogen from the soil for plant growth and returns biomass to the soil on harvest     4. A Nodule organ which is only activated and fixes nitrogen for the legume crops.  An Arbitrator is also included which determines the allocation of drymatter and nitrogen biomass between each of these organs.#Inclusion in APSIM simulationsA scrum crop is included in a simulation the same as any other APSIM crop   * The SCRUM object needs to be dragged or copied from the Crop folder in the tool box into the field of your simulation.   * It is then planted with a sowing rule  ~~~SCRUM.Sow(cultivar: Wheat_Autumn, population: 1, depth: 10, rowSpacing: 150);  ~~~  * Note that SCRUM has no notion of population or rowSpacing but these parameters are required by the Sow method so filler values are provided    * To specify an expected Expected Yield that differs to the defalt value provided, included the following code in a manager script to be executed on the day of sowing.~~~ zone.Set([SCRUM].Product.ExpectedYield.Value(), ResetValue);  ~~~* SCRUM can be Harvested, Cut, Grazed and Pruned like other crops.  Defalt proportions of the biomass in each organ are removed from the sysem and/or added to the fields residue pools.  Note that defalt removal fraction for product on harvest is 0 (becaue it is represented with a generic organ) so more appropriate removal fractions should be sepcified in a manager script as follows:  ~~~[EventSubscribe(Commencing)]  private void OnSimulationCommencing(object sender, EventArgs e)  {    Remove = new RemovalFractions(SCRUM.Organs);  }  [EventSubscribe(DoManagement)]    private void OnDoManagement(object sender, EventArgs e)  {    if (Clock.Today.Date == HarvestDate2)    {      Remove.SetFractionLiveToRemove(Product, 1.0);    Remove.SetFractionLiveToRemove(Stover, 0.05);      Remove.SetFractionLiveToResidue(Stover,0.95)    SCRUM.Harvest(Remove);      SCRUM.EndCrop();    }  }  ~~~* A Remove class as shown above can be sent with Harvest, Cut, Graze and Prune events to specificy the proportions of removals. * Once a crop has been ended the field is open to plant another crop using another APSIM crop model or sowing another SCRUM crop.

Each organ can have up to three different pools of biomass:* **Structural biomass** which is essential for growth and remains within the organ once it is allocated there.* **Metabolic biomass** which generally remains within an organ but is able to be re allocated when the organ senesces and may be retranslocated when demand is high relative to supply.* **Storage biomass** which is partitioned to organs when supply is high relative to demand and is available for retranslocation to other organs whenever supply from uptake, fixation, or re allocation is lower than demand.The process followed for biomass arbitration is shown in the figure below. Arbitration calculations are triggered by a series of events (shown below) that are raised every day.  For these calculations, at each step the Arbitrator exchange information with each organ, so the basic computations of demand and supply are done at the organ level, using their specific parameters. 1. **doPotentialPlantGrowth**.  When this event occurs, each organ class executes code to determine their potential growth, biomass supplies and demands.  In addition to demands for structural, non structural and metabolic biomass (DM and N) each organ may have the following biomass supplies: * **Fixation supply**.  From photosynthesis (DM) or symbiotic fixation (N)* **Uptake supply**.  Typically uptake of N from the soil by the roots but could also be uptake by other organs (eg foliage application of N).* **Retranslocation supply**.  Storage biomass that may be moved from organs to meet demands of other organs.* **Reallocation supply**. Biomass that can be moved from senescing organs to meet the demands of other organs.2. **doPotentialPlantPartitioning.** On this event the Arbitrator first executes the DoDMSetup() method to gather the DM supplies and demands from each organ, these values are computed at the organ level.  It then executes the DoPotentialDMAllocation() method which works out how much biomass each organ would be allocated assuming N supply is not limiting and sends these allocations to the organs.  Each organ then uses their potential DM allocation to determine their N demand (how much N is needed to produce that much DM) and the arbitrator calls DoNSetup() to gather the N supplies and demands from each organ and begin N arbitration.  Firstly DoNReallocation() is called to redistribute N that the plant has available from senescing organs.  After this step any unmet N demand is considered as plant demand for N uptake from the soil (N Uptake Demand).3. **doNutrientArbitration.** When this event occurs, the soil arbitrator gets the N uptake demands from each plant (where multiple plants are growing in competition) and their potential uptake from the soil and determines how much of their demand that the soil is able to provide.  This value is then passed back to each plant instance as their Nuptake and doNUptakeAllocation() is called to distribute this N between organs.  4. **doActualPlantPartitioning.**  On this event the arbitrator call DoNRetranslocation() and DoNFixation() to satisfy any unmet N demands from these sources.  Finally, DoActualDMAllocation is called where DM allocations to each organ are reduced if the N allocation is insufficient to achieve the organs minimum N concentration and final allocations are sent to organs. ![Schematic showing the procedure for arbitration of biomass partitioning.
