It was a daily time step implementation of the crop model that is used in the Overseer nutrient balance model [Cichota_etal_2010] and was parameterised for over 50 different crop types.  However, a number of limitations had been identified with the model and the crop parameterisations were location and sowing time specific so it did not achieve wide spread use.  An updated version was put into release in June 2025 which retains the same underlying concepts but has a different approach for modelling phenology, making it easy to parameterise the model for any situation.  This makes it relevant for modelling any annual crop at any point on the globe providing the user setting the crop parameters has a good understanding of the crops behaviour in the situations being simulated.**Note:  The updated version is different to the first version in its underlying model structure, the way it is parameterised and the way in integrates into simulations.  As such it is not possible to maintain backward compatibility of simulations configured prior to June 2025.  Unfortunately, users will need to update these simulations manually be removing the old version of SCRUM for simulations and replacing it with the new version by following the instructions below.**The SCRUM model serves two main purposes:1. To represent annual crops in APSIM simulations that we do not yet have a detailed model for and/or lack the experimental data required to parametrise one.  SCRUM has been designed to be parameterised with some basic crop information that an expert in a specific crop type will have close to hand.  This provides an alternative to using another crop model as a proxy when we are simulating rotations that include crops with no detailed crop model.2. For studies that are not primarily interested in the crop and don’t want to invest a lot of time in setting the crop component of simulations but still need something to provide sensible boundaries to the nitrogen and water balance.To be able to represent a broad range of annual crops, SCRUM makes a number of simplifications:* It does not predict potential yield.  This is a user input and a value must be provided that is sensible for the context being simulated.  Harvest index and root proportion coefficients are used to determine stover and root biomass.  Crop yields may be less than the yield specified if stress events occur.* Daily patterns of biomass accumulation, cover, root depth and height are calculated from basic linear and sigmoidal functions anchored to phenological stages as shown below.![Schematic of biomass, cover, root depth and height with crop development stages](SCRUM_Patterns.jpg)* The model does not predict when harvests occur.  Instead, the user provides dates and crop stages for establishment and harvest as inputs.  Scrum scales its development patterns (shown above) between the user specified dates and stages to give daily patterns.  An example for biomass accumulation patterns is shown in the figure below.  Dotted, dashed and solid lines represent seedling, emergence and seed establishment stages respectively.   All of the patterns displayed are possible depending on which stage is specified for establishment and harvest. So  a wide range of development patterns can be simulated by changing the establishment and harvest dates and stages to represent different situations.* Establishment Stages:    - _Seed_ is selected to represent a crop that is sown and emerges after establishment date.   - _Emergence_ is selected if the crop is to start growing on the day of establishment   - _Seedling_ is selected to represent transplanted crops that already have some biomass and leaf area on the day of establishment.* Harvest Stages:   - _Vegetative_ is selected for crops such as lettuce that are harvested while still in rapid growth.   - _Early_, _Mid_ and _Late Reproductive_ are other options for crops that are harvested before maturity such as whole crop silage, fresh legumes and oil seeds (respectively)   - _Maturity_ is selected for a crop that is harvested as soon as biomass accumulation has finished   - _Ripe_ is selected for crops that are harvested after maturity and a period of field drying as for most cereals.![Schematic of biomass, accumulation patterns possible with different establishment and harvest stages.  Dotted, dashed and solid lines represent seedling, emergence and seed establishment stages respectively](SCRUM_Scaling.jpg)* Water stress responses may be switched on or off by the user depending on the simulation needs.  When water stress is switched on it will affect crop cover and biomass accumulation.* Nitrogen stress reduces biomass accumulation if there is insufficient N to meat minimum N concentration of growing organs.  Nitrogen stress does not affect cover.* SCRUM is not released with sets of coefficients to represent different crop types.  Instead a ScrumCropInstance model is included in a simulation where the user sets coefficients to represent the crop required.  This provides great flexibility for parameterising crops but puts the responsibility for having sensible parameters on the model user.  The name of a ScrumCropInstance is arbitrary and you may include as many as are needed to provide all the crops for a simulation.* SCRUM is not established with a .Sow() command the same as other crops.  Instead, it is established with an .Establish() command that includes harvest date, expected yield and other data (see below for more detail).* There is a SCRUM rotation component that can be used for specifying rotations of SCRUM crops without needing to use a manager.  It is possible to trigger these events from manager if more sophisticated set ups are required.The SCRUM model is built using the Plant Modelling Framework (PMF) of [brown_plant_2014] so it interfaces with other APSIM models in the same way as other plant models. SCRUM has 4 organ classes to represent different biomass components. The real biomass components that these classes represent change from crop to crop:     1. A Simple leaf class called <b>Stover</b> which represents the unharvested parts of the plant.  Generally, this represents the leaf and stem components of the crop but for crops where stem and leaf are part of the harvested product (e.g forages and leafy vegetables) than stover is the residual fraction of leaf and stem that is not harvested.     2. A Generic organ class called <b>Product</b> which represents the plant parts that are harvested and removed from the field.  This could represent grain, fruits, tubers, leaf or stem depending on what sort of crop is being represented.     3. A Root organ which extracts water and nitrogen from the soil for plant growth and returns biomass to the soil on harvest     4. A Nodule organ which is only activated and fixes nitrogen for the legume crops.  # Using SCRUM in simulations.Some working examples and a number of parameterised ScrumCropInstances are provided in the SCRUM simulation in Examples.  These are meant to provide a start point and users should carefully review these parameterisations and adapt them to best represent the crops being simulated.To use SCRUM in a simulation you must add the SCRUM model, at least one ScrumCropInstance and a manager model to establish the crop.  The parameters in the ScrumCropInstance are:* Harvest Index - The proportion of total biomass that is in the harvested product (0-1).* Product Moisture Content - The proportion of the harvested yield that is moisture (g/g).  A value of zero is used if input yields are in dry weight and a value between zero and 1 is used if the input yields include some moisture.  A value of up to 0.95 is possible for crops like lettice that have very high moisture contents.* Root biomass proportion - The proportion of total biomass that is in the roots (0-1).  The sum of the root proportion and harvest index must be less than 1.* Root depth at maturity (mm) - SCRUM grows roots from sowing depth to Root Depth at maturity so an appropriate value for the mature crop must be specified.  This will interact with soil limitations (XF) so roots may not reach the depth specified.  Also note that roots don't reach mature depth until the EarlyReproductive stage so crops harvested at the Vegetative stage will not reach the root depth specified.  * Crop height at maturity (mm)- is the ultimate hight of the crop.* Maximum green cover (0-1) is the highest value of cover that the crop would be expected to achieve depending on row spacing and crop width.  Note that cover will be reduced in response to water stress so may not reach the values specified.* Extinction coefficient (0.4-1) is a parameter that describes how quickly cover increases with increased LAI.  A value of 1.0 represents a prostrate leaved crop and this decreases for crops with more erect leaves.  * Stage for Nconc parameters.  Nconc declines as the crop develops so a crop harvested at the vegetative stage (e.g. forage cereals) would have higher Nconc than the same crop if it were taken to maturity.  The Nconc parameters for product and stover (below) represent the value at the development stage selected here.  The model then scales them up or down for a given simulation if the harvest stage used differs to this stage.  This allow us to achieve sensible Nconc at harvest with a single ScrumCropInstance when harvesting at different stages.* Nitrogen concentration at seedling stage (g/g).  At an early stage a crop is predominantly leaf and an Nconc of 0.05 is typical for most plants.  Nconc declines from this value at the start of simulations to lower values at harvest.* Nitrogen concentration of product at harvest (g/g).  This is the nitrogen concentration of the harvested product at the stage specified for Nconc parameters.  The model may grow to Nconcs higher or lower than this if it is harvested before or after the specified Stage for Nconc parameters.* Nitrogen concentration of Stover at harvest (g/g).  This is the nitrogen concentration of any above ground biomass not removed by harvest, at the stage specified for Nconc parameters.  The model may grow to Nconcs higher or lower than this if it is harvested before or after the stage specified for Nconc parameters.* Nitrogen concentration of Roots (g/g).  As the name infers.* Base, Optimum and Maximum temperatures (<sup>o</sup>C) are specified for the accumulation of thermal time.  Although harvest dates are provided as a user input, patterns of biomass accumulation, cover, root depth and height are all driven by thermal time so it is important that appropriate values are specified so seasonal growth and development patterns are sensible.* Thermal Time required from sowing to emergence.  If the crop is established at the seed stage this is how much thermal time it will take to emerge.* Maximum Canopy Conductance - This controls crop transpiration demand.* Net radiation at 50% of maximum conductance - This also controls transpiration demand and how it responds to radiation levels.* Does the crop respond to water stress?  If checked biomass and cover accumulation will decrease if water stress occurs.  The SCRUM crop instance sets the basic parameters for a Scrum crop.  Additional parameters must also be sent when the crop is established.  To establish a SCRUM crop a manager model must be included that links to the appropriate ScrumCropInstance as shown below: ~~~ScrumCropInstance SCRUMCrop = zone.FindDescendant<ScrumCropInstance>(CropName);~~~It must then create a ScrumManagementInstance that contains the SCRUM management parameters:~~~ScrumManagementInstance management = new ScrumManagementInstance(                  cropName: SCRUMCereal,                  establishDate: clock.Today,                  establishStage: Seed,                  plantingDepth: 20,                  harvestStage: Ripe,                  expectedYield: 1000,                  harvestDate: 23/4/2021,                  ttEstablishmentToHarvest: ,                  fieldLoss: 0.05,                  residueRemoval: 0,                  residueIncorporation: 0,                  residueIncorporationDepth: 0                                                                );~~~the meaning of the management parameters is:* cropName: Name corresponding exactly to the name of the ScrumCropInstance to be established* establishDate: The date the crop is established on* establishStage: The development stage at the time of establishment* plantingDepth: in mm,* harvestStage: The stage the crop is harvested at,* expectedYield: The yield expected if the crop does not encounter nitrogen or water stress. * harvestDate: The date the crop is harvested (This is not needed if ttEstablishmentToHarvest is specified)* ttEstablishmentToHarvest: Thermal time from establishment to harvest (This is not needed if harvest date specified)* fieldLoss: (0-1) The proportion of gross product yield that is not harvested and remains in the field as residues.

Each organ can have up to three different pools of biomass:* **Structural biomass** which is essential for growth and remains within the organ once it is allocated there.* **Metabolic biomass** which generally remains within an organ but is able to be re allocated when the organ senesces and may be retranslocated when demand is high relative to supply.* **Storage biomass** which is partitioned to organs when supply is high relative to demand and is available for retranslocation to other organs whenever supply from uptake, fixation, or re allocation is lower than demand.The process followed for biomass arbitration is shown in the figure below. Arbitration calculations are triggered by a series of events (shown below) that are raised every day.  For these calculations, at each step the Arbitrator exchange information with each organ, so the basic computations of demand and supply are done at the organ level, using their specific parameters.1. **doPotentialPlantGrowth**.  When this event occurs, each organ class executes code to determine their potential growth, biomass supplies and demands.  In addition to demands for structural, non structural and metabolic biomass (DM and N) each organ may have the following biomass supplies:* **Fixation supply**.  From photosynthesis (DM) or symbiotic fixation (N)* **Uptake supply**.  Typically uptake of N from the soil by the roots but could also be uptake by other organs (eg foliage application of N).* **Retranslocation supply**.  Storage biomass that may be moved from organs to meet demands of other organs.* **Reallocation supply**. Biomass that can be moved from senescing organs to meet the demands of other organs.2. **doPotentialPlantPartitioning.** On this event the Arbitrator first executes the DoDMSetup() method to gather the DM supplies and demands from each organ, these values are computed at the organ level.  It then executes the DoPotentialDMAllocation() method which works out how much biomass each organ would be allocated assuming N supply is not limiting and sends these allocations to the organs.  Each organ then uses their potential DM allocation to determine their N demand (how much N is needed to produce that much DM) and the arbitrator calls DoNSetup() to gather the N supplies and demands from each organ and begin N arbitration.  Firstly DoNReallocation() is called to redistribute N that the plant has available from senescing organs.  After this step any unmet N demand is considered as plant demand for N uptake from the soil (N Uptake Demand).3. **doNutrientArbitration.** When this event occurs, the soil arbitrator gets the N uptake demands from each plant (where multiple plants are growing in competition) and their potential uptake from the soil and determines how much of their demand that the soil is able to provide.  This value is then passed back to each plant instance as their Nuptake and doNUptakeAllocation() is called to distribute this N between organs.4. **doActualPlantPartitioning.**  On this event the arbitrator call DoNRetranslocation() and DoNFixation() to satisfy any unmet N demands from these sources.  Finally, DoActualDMAllocation is called where DM allocations to each organ are reduced if the N allocation is insufficient to achieve the organs minimum N concentration and final allocations are sent to organs.![Schematic showing the procedure for arbitration of biomass partitioning.
