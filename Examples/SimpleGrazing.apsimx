      "Text": "This example has simulations on how the SimpleGrazing model works and can be tailored to user's needs. The model is an upgrade to the CutRotation manager and allows different options to trigger the start of grazing.\n\nThe *Urine and Dung* component of the model will always be active in any of the settings that rule a grazing event. First the user has the option of setting up one value, which is the same for the whole period, or values that vary according to the month of the year. Then the depth at wich urine is added can be set. After that, the proportion of N going to dung  can be set by the user. This can be done by providing a single value for the whole period or 12 monthly values, to vary the proportion according to the month of the year. Finally, the C:N ratio of the biomass for dung can be set. Here, if a value of 0 is used, the model will use DM digestibility to calculate the C:N ratio. \n\n**SimpleRotation**\n\n>This setting is an example of how a simple grazing based on a interval of fixed days happens. The residual mass after grazing can be set by the user in order to end a grazing event. The minimum DM amount available for a grazing event to happen can also be set up at the *Minimum grazeable dry matter to trigger grazing*. In this setting, there is the option to set up an *Optional no-grazing window*. This allows the user to stop any grazing event from happening between the *Start of the no-grazing window* and *End of the no-grazing window*, independently of any other rule set up to trigger the grazing event. If values are not provided, the model just ignores it.\n\n**TargetMass**\n\n>This setting allows the user to set up a DM production target to trigger grazing at the *Monthly target mass of pasture to trigger grazing event*. Here 12 values are needed, one for each month of the year, and they can vary as the user wishes. The residual mass to stop the grazing event can be set at the *Monthly mass of pasture post grazing*. Monthly values can also vary as the user wishes. The user can also set up the *Optional no-grazing* component for this setting. \n\n**TimingControlledElsewhere**\n\n>This setting allows the user to set up the grazing rules somewhere else in APSIM, as in an *Operations* component for example. The rules for N and C return cal still be set up at the *SimpleGrazing* user interface. The *Operations* component used in the example presented here is called *Grazing* and there are different methods to trigger the grazing event. When *Graze* is used, the DM amount provided by the user will be the amount to be removed at each grazing event. In this example, the first date shows that 3000 kgDM/ha will be removed on the date specified. The other available method is *GrazeToResidual*, where the amount provided by the user will be what is left after grazing. In the example, the second date shows that on the date specified, the pasture will be grazed down to a residual mass of 2000 kgDM/ha. This is the only setting where the *Optional no-grazing window* will not be available.\n\n**FlexibleGrazingCover**\n\n>In this setting, the user can trigger a grazing event via an expression. This example triggers grazing when the canopy (green and dead material) intercepts 95% of the total incoming radiation. The intelisense will work in this component to make it easier for the user to set up the expression needed. This method also supports more elaborate expressions, which can be needed when the simulation deals with mixed species. The simulation *Ryegrass_WhiteClover* is an example of how to trigger grazing when the combination of above ground weight of ryegrass and the standing biomass of white clover are above 3000 kgDM/ha. Note that here we use the 'standing biomass' for white clover because the value used will not consider the stolon mass. If we wanted to account for the stolon mass, 'above ground' would be the output used. \n\n**Ryegrass_WhiteClover**\n>This is just an example of how SimpleGrazing works with mixed pastures.\n\n**OptionalRulesForRotation**\n>The user has the option of setting up rules to make sure that grazing events occur despite of not reaching the biomass triggers for grazing (residual or pre grazing). This option is available for the **TargetMass** and **FlexibleGrazing** settings. The *Monthly maximum roation length* is the maximum number of days that the simulation can go without having a grazing event. For example, if we use a maximum rotation length of 50 days it means that, if the pre grazing biomass set up by the user is not reached within 50 days of the last grazing, a grazing event will happen at 50 days.\n>The *Monthly minimum rotation length* is the minimum number of days when a grazing event will not happen, indepently of the target conditions. For example, if a value of 5 days is used as the minimum rotation length, this means that another grazing event cannot happen within 5 days of the last grazing, independently of the biomass targets being met. \n\n\n",
