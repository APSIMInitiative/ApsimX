### Issue best practices

* The issue title is important. It must be a sentence accurately describing the issue. It is also used as the release description when installing or upgrading APSIM. Having a good description helps the user to decide which release version to download.
* Describe issues with an emphasis on the "Why" more than "What" or "How". The issue description should be clear enough that another person should be able to fix the problem or create the feature.
* Submit issues before you begin creating a solution. This has the advantage of avoiding unnecessary effort if the issue is found to be resolved or in the process of being resolved and allows others to suggest possible approaches and considerations that can improve the subsequent PR.
* For defects:
  * Defect issues must be reproducible. Include a simulation file with required met and input files in a zip archive.
  * Describe the steps to reproduce the defect. This includes details like where you clicked, what settings were enabled and what operating system it occurred on.
  * For graphical user interface (GUI) issues please submit a minimally reproducible example apsim file, describe the user interface model this issue affects and the steps to reproduce the error.
