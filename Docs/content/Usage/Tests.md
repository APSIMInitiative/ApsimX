title: "Test Results"
draft: false

To test your data, you can add something like this to a manager script:

```csharp
using System;
using Models.Core;
namespace Models
{
    [Serializable]
    public class Script : Model, ITest
    {
        public void Run()
        {
            bool testHasFailed = true;
            if (testHasFailed)
                throw new Exception("oh dear");
        }
    }
}
```

Things to note:

 * Any failures should be handled by throwing an exception.
 * Whenever Apsim finishes running simulations, it will run all `IModel`s which implement the `ITest` interface. Therefore, the script must inherit from `Model`
 * `ITest` is defined in the `Models.Core` namespace
 * By default, Apsim will not run these tests when run from the command line, unless the `--run-tests` command line switch is provided. If you don't know what the command line is, this will not affect you.
 * [Jenkins](http://www.apsim.info:8080/jenkins) will run these tests whenever a pull request is run. Therefore, all files under the Examples, Prototypes, and Tests directories are guaranteed to be tested.
