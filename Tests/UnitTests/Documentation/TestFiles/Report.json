The upper box (Properties) holds descriptions of what should be reported. The general syntax is:			[Model].VariableThe first part, [Model] just above, gives the name of a model in the simulation. Models are almost any component in the simulation - e.g. Clock, Weather, Wheat, Irrigation - including Manager scripts (although these are a slightly special case and more on that below). The name of the model must be in square brackets. As with Manager scripts, Properties uses Intellisense to assist with constructing the output descriptors. For example, see row 1 of Figure 1. After typing [Clock] once a . is typed a drop-down list of possible variables will appear as hints and in Figure 1 the choice from the list was Today which gives the date of the simulation output. *Note that model and variable names are case-sensitive. Capitalisation in the right places is important.*The component ReportSimple shows four output examples (see also below). The second row (see also below) shows an example of relabelling the output (the as DairyRainfall text) - this simply allows the user to give a more relevant label for the output in the output file. 			[Weather].Rain as DailyRainfallThe third row shows that it may be necessary to work through several layers to get to the output wanted. In each case a . after the variable name gives a list with hints for outputs.			[Wheat].Grain.Total.WtThe fourth row (also below) shows the special case of reporting an output from a Manager script. The first part ([SowingRule]) is the name of the Manager script (so the output text needs to say current with any name changes you might make). Outputs from Managers always need a .Script before Intellisense will show the possible outputs.			[SowingRule].Script.SowingDepth## Reporting frequency - setting up when reports should happenAlso needed is a specification of *when* an output should be made. The instruction for when to report is in the form of:			[Model].Event or Date(s)### EventAn Event is something that happens, like a stage of the day or a management action. The most-used example of a reporting frequency is:			[Clock].EndOfDayand this creates an output for every EndOfDay event - EndOfDay is an event created by Clock every day after all the models have done their calculations. Any (almost) event can be used to control the frequency of reporting such as:			[Wheat].Sowing			[Wheat].Flowering			[Wheat].Harvesting			[Wheat].PlantEnding			[Irrigation].Irrigated			[Fertiliser].Fertilisedwhere “Wheat” might be any crop. This also shows that multiple triggers for reporting can be used. It is worth noting that when an event is used to trigger reporting, the output happens immediately rather than at the end of the simulation day. If you are getting strange outputs then consider this as a possible reason. To understand more about what order models do their calculations see https://apsimnextgeneration.netlify.app/development/.### DatesIn addition to specifying events, you can also specify one or more dates in the frequency window. Dates can be specified one per line at be in either dd-mmm or dd-mmm-yyyy form e.g.		1-jul		1-jul-1980Note that there can be a mixture of events and dates.### Conditional reportingInstead of specifying event names or a list of dates, you can specify a conditional function that when evaluated to true will cause a line of output to be written to the report table. For example:		Clock.Today >= new DateTime(2011, 2, 21)will do daily outputs after the 21st February 2011. Conditional functions always start with the if keyword. They are written in C# (like a manager script) and need to be wholely contained on a single line. Multiple conditional statments can be specified - one per line. Another example:		Clock.Today >= new DateTime(2011, 2, 21) && Clock.Today <= new DateTime(2011, 12, 31)This will do daily outputs between 21st February 2011 and the end of 2011.## Reporting at irregular intervals or specific datesIf reporting is needed for particular days (e.g. to compare against measurements in an experiment) a combination of a Manager and a Report component will do the trick. An example of such a Manager (**ReportHelper**) and two Report components (**ReportOnSpecificDaysEveryYear** and **ReportOnSpecificDates**) are included in this example. Note that when using a Manager to control reporting, the Report frequency in the Report component should be left blank.[Note that an Operations component could also be used to trigger irregular reporting dates.]"}]},{"type": "APSIM.Shared.Documentation.Section", "text": "Dealing with outputs that have layers", "children": [{"type": "APSIM.Shared.Documentation.Paragraph", "text": "Several of the outputs from APSIM are arrays - water content in the soil layers is a good example of this - and there are some features that make reporting arrays easier in APSIM.To report all elements of an array, the syntax is the same as reporting a single variable. See for example in Row 2 of ReportArrays the text			[Soil].SoilWater.SWmmproduces one column of output for each element (soil layer) in the array. When a particular layer is wanted then specify that in square brackets so the [1] is the top (closest to the soil surface) layer. For example,			[Soil].SoilWater.SWmm[1] as TopLayerWater_mmMore often some sort of aggregation is in the array is wanted and for this it is necessary to specify both which elements of the array are to be aggregated and what type of aggregation is wanted. There are four options for specifying how the array elements should be aggregated - Sum, Mean, Min and Max - the meaning of these is self-evident. These are applied to the array as, for example Mean(x) where the x is the output to be averaged. Use round brackets, capitalise the aggregation type and no spaces.For specifying how the aggregation is to work there are several options. Giving no layer information at all includes all of the array. A range is specified as, for example [3:6] for the third to sixth (inclusive, here meaning four layers) layers. Giving the colon but no numerical value means from the first (e.g. [:5]) or to the last (e.g. [2:]) elements. Report will not indicate the depth of the layers but the user can either get this information from the Soil input or can output the data using [Soil].Thickness which is an array giving the thickness of each layer in mm.Some examples of possible array outputs to show the syntax are:			Sum([Soil].Thickness[1:3]) as DepthToBottomOfLayer3			Sum([Soil].SoilWater.SWmm) as TotalWaterStored			Sum([Soil].SoilWater.SWmm[1:2]) as WaterStoredTop2Layers			Sum([Soil].SoilWater.SWmm[1:3]) as WaterStoredTop3Layers			Sum([Soil].SoilWater.SWmm[4:]) as WaterStoredLayer4AndBelow			Sum([Soil].SoilWater.SWmm[:6]) as WaterStoredDowntoLayer6			Mean([Soil].Nutrient.NO3.ppm[1:4]) as MeanNO3ppmTop4Layers			Min([Soil].Nutrient.NO3.ppm[1:4]) as MinNO3ppmTop4Layers			Max([Soil].Nutrient.NO3.ppm[1:4]) as MaxNO3ppmTop4LayersSimple, element-by-element, array operations can be included in the specification. For example			[Soil].Nutrient.Urea.kgha + [Soil].Nutrient.NH4.kgha + [Soil].Nutrient.NO3.kghawill produce one column of data for each soil layer with the total of the amount of N as Urea, NH4 and NO3. Inserting			Sum([Soil].Nutrient.Urea.kgha[1:3] + [Soil].Nutrient.NH4.kgha[1:3] + [Soil].Nutrient.NO3.kgha[1:3]) as MineralNwill give a single column of data with the total of Urea-N, NH4-N and NO3-N dfrom the surface the the bottom of the third layer. These expressions can get more complex as in:			Sum([Soil].Nutrient.Urea.kgha[1:3] + [Soil].Nutrient.NH4.kgha[1:3] + [Soil].Nutrient.NO3.kgha[1:3]) * 1000 / Sum([Soil].Thickness[1:3] ) as KgMinN_PerSoilMeterwhich would give s single (somewhat nonsensical) output of the accumulation in mineral N with depth in the soil.

It is recommended that the results be critically evaluated to ensure that the reporting specified is as intended.*APSIM allows reporting at various intervals. Several of these methods have been described above. In addition to the usual [Clock].EndOfDay for daily reporting, [Clock] also has events of EndOfWeek, EndOfMonth, EndOfYear and EndOfSimulation. When the reporting is not every day then it is necessary to consider what the aggregation of the output should be. Some variables would usually be reported as their value on the day – many state variables (e.g. plant biomass) are like this. Others are almost always wanted to be summed over the interval since the last report – drainage and evaporation are good examples here. APSIM provides several ways to construct the aggregations. Not all the aggregations will be sensible for all outputs and it is up to the user to ensure the sensibility of the instructions to Report. For example, it makes no physical sense to sum the biomass of a plant in a monthly aggregation. It would make sense to report the value at the end of the month or to report the increase (difference) in biomass from the start to the end and it might make sense to report an average biomass. These issues must be considered when constructing more complex Report specifications. The general syntax of aggregated reporting is:			AggregationType of [Model].Variable from Start to End as LabelThe new elements here are *AggregationType*, *Start* and *End*.## AggregationTypeAggregationType can be any of:-	Sum of-	Mean of-	Min of -	Max of-	First of-	Last of -	Diff ofMost of these are self-evident. First and Last are chronological values. Diff is the increase in the output variable over the reporting interval – if the variable decreases then it will have a negative value.## StartThe most useful form of *Start* is *[ReportName].DateOfLastOutput* where the first part is the name of the current Report component. *DateOfLastOutput* is pretty much as stated. Other *Start* constructs might be a general, e.g. *1-jan*, or specific, e.g. *1-jan-1982*, date. *Start* can also be an event, e.g. *[Wheat].sowing* or *[Clock].StartOfYear*. When *Start* is a Clock or Report event the aggregation always starts at the start of the day. For events created by crop or other models the event can happen at any point of the day and it is not always clear without careful examination if the current-day calculations and updates will be included or excluded. This is user-beware.## End*[Clock].Today* is the most useful *End* specification. This means that the end of the aggregation will be controlled by the Report frequency. *End* can also be an event, e.g. *[Wheat].Harvesting* or a general or specific date. As with *Start* and events, treat these with caution. Always consider the interaction between the aggregation interval and the report frequency. For example if the report frequency is *[Clock].EndOfMonth*:						Sum of [Weather].Rain from [Report].DateOfLastOutput to [Clock].Today will produce a monthly rainfall total while						Sum of [Weather].Rain from 1-jan to [Clock].Today will produce a cumulative rainfall as the months of the year progress and the accumulation will reset again on the next 1-Jan.## Some examplesThe figures below show some aggregation examples of daily, weekly, monthly and annual aggregation reporting maximum temperature in various ways. Note that an aggregation to the end of the simulation is also possible.
