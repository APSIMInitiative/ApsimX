   abstract = {Continuous increase in the yield of maize (Zea mays L.) in the U.S. Corn Belt has involved an interaction with plant density. A number of contributing traits and mechanisms have been suggested. In this study we used a modeling approach to examine whether changes in canopy and/or root system architecture might explain the observed trends. A maize crop model was generalized so that changes in canopy and root system architecture could be examined. A layered, diurnal canopy photosynthesis model was introduced to predict consequences of change in canopy architecture. A two-dimensional root exploration model was introduced to predict consequences of change in root system architecture. Field experiments were conducted to derive model parameters for the base hybrid (Pioneer 3394). Simulation studies for various canopy and root system architectures were undertaken for a range of sites, soils, and densities. Simulated responses to density compared well with those found in field experiments. The analysis indicated that (i) change in root system architecture and water capture had a direct effect on biomass accumulation and historical yield trends; and (ii) change in canopy architecture had little direct effect but likely had important indirect effects via leaf area retention and partitioning of carbohydrate to the ear. The study provided plausible explanations and identified testable hypotheses for future research and crop improvement effort.},

   systems modeling platform that is used worldwide to address research
   questions related to agricultural systems. We explored whether APSIM
   performs well in the Midwest, so that the associated model capabilities
   would be available for application in this region. Our approach included
   calibration and testing of several APSIM models (maize {[}Zea mays L.],
   soil water, soil N, surface organic matter, manure, and soil
   temperature) and evaluation of model predictions against independent
   datasets. During calibration we developed local crop and soil parameters
   so that the model captured sufficiently well dynamics of soil water
   (root mean square error, RMSE = 0.032 mm mm(-1)), soil temperature (RMSE
   = 2.1 degrees C), soil inorganic N dynamics (RMSE = 12.6 kg N ha(-1)),
   contrasting soil net N mineralization patterns under fresh and composted
   swine manure applications (RMSE = 13.6 kg N ha(-1)), crop phenology
   (RMSE = 1.52 d), leaf area index (RMSE = 0.60 m(2) m(-2)), leaf N
   concentration (RMSE = 0.28 kg 100 kg(-1)), canopy N uptake (RMSE = 9.0
   kg N ha(-1)), biomass production (RMSE = 0.77 Mg ha(-1)) and grain yield
   (RMSE = 0.53 Mg ha(-1)). The calibration protocol followed in this study
   is discussed in detail. The calibrated model was evaluated against
   independent data on grain yield (RMSE = 0.65 Mg ha(-1)), biomass
   production (RMSE = 1.1 Mg ha(-1)) and LAI (RMSE = 1.14 m(2) m(-2)),
   showing very acceptable performance, especially in addressing yield-N
   relationships. Therefore APSIM proves to be a reliable model that can be
   used as a research and decision tool to enhance Midwestern production

   abstract = {In New Zealand and worldwide, growers are increasingly being required to demonstrate that their nutrient management does not have adverse effects on the environment. Since routine direct measurements of nitrogen (N) losses at an appropriate scale are currently unfeasible, a modelling tool that can be used to assess losses, both actual and potential, from farming systems is therefore needed. We present the upgraded N balance module for cropping systems (OVCrop) developed to be incorporated into the OVERSEER<sup>«</sup> Nutrient Budgets model. It presents an easy-to-use interface, requiring few but meaningful inputs, with the minimum flexibility needed to describe management of real farming systems. Following the developmental guidelines of OVERSEER<sup>«</sup> Nutrient Budget, OVCrop is designed to provide the long-term annual average of N leaching from any user-defined cropping rotation. OVCrop has been parameterized based on process-based model simulations for typical farm systems and environments of New Zealand. The intended use of the OVCrop is to help on-farm nutrient management and to demonstrate future compliance to N leaching regulations. OVCrop is a robust tool, simple enough to be used by people with a low to medium level of expertise, such as farmers and regional councils.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Plant Modelling Framework (PMF) is a software framework for creating models that represent the plant components of farm system models in the agricultural production system simulator (APSIM). It is the next step in the evolution of generic crop templates for APSIM, building on software and science lessons from past versions and capitalising on new software approaches. The PMF contains a top-level Plant class that provides an interface with the APSIM model environment and controls the other classes in the plant model. Other classes include mid-level Organ, Phenology, Structure and Arbitrator classes that represent specific elements or processes of the crop and sub-classes that the mid-level classes use to represent repeated data structures. It also contains low-level Function classes which represent generic mathematical, logical, procedural or reference code and provide values to the processes carried out by mid-level classes. A plant configuration file specifies which mid-level and Function classes are to be included and how they are to be arranged and parameterised to represent a particular crop model. The PMF has an integrated design environment to allow plant models to be created visually. The aims of the PMF are to maximise code reuse and allow flexibility in the structure of models. Four examples are included to demonstrate the flexibility of application of the PMF; 1. Slurp, a simple model of the water use of a static crop, 2. Oat, an annual grain crop model with detailed growth, development and resource use processes, 3. Lucerne, perennial forage model with detailed growth, development and resource use processes, 4. Wheat, another detailed annual crop model constructed using an alternative set of organ and process classes. These examples show the PMF can be used to develop models of different complexities and allows flexibility in the approach for implementing crop physiology concepts into model set up.},

	abstract = {Abstract Oil palm has become one of the most important crops in the world with questions being raised about its economic and environmental sustainability. Agricultural systems models are regularly employed in studying sustainable crop management but no detailed model is currently available for oil palm systems. We developed a production systems model for oil palm within the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) framework and tested it using data across a range of environments within Papua New Guinea (PNG). The model captured key growth responses to climate and management. This demonstrates that modern modelling frameworks do allow for rapid model development for new agricultural systems. However, whilst application of the model is promising, the availability of key data is likely to restrict its use. Local soil and weather data are not available in adequate detail for many of the major oil palm production areas, although some methods exist to address this.},

APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator) is one such model that continues to be applied and adapted to this challenging research agenda. From its inception twenty years ago, APSIM has evolved into a framework containing many of the key models required to explore changes in agricultural landscapes with capability ranging from simulation of gene expression through to multi-field farms and beyond.

Keating et al. (2003) described many of the fundamental attributes of APSIM in detail. Much has changed in the last decade, and the APSIM community has been exploring novel scientific domains and utilising software developments in social media, web and mobile applications to provide simulation tools adapted to new demands.

This paper updates the earlier work by Keating et al. (2003) and chronicles the changing external challenges and opportunities being placed on APSIM during the last decade. It also explores and discusses how APSIM has been evolving to a “next generation” framework with improved features and capabilities that allow its use in many diverse topics.},

   abstract = {A more-efficient use of resources is a major reason advanced for the advantage of intercropping over alternative cropping systems. This paper reviews the interception and utilization of solar radiation in intercropping systems. To achieve this, a framework is presented on radiation interception and use in sole crops and elements of this framework are subsequently extended to intercropping systems. Improved productivity per unit incident radiation could be achieved by the adoption of an intercropping system that either increases the interception of solar radiation and/or has greater radiation-use efficiency. Minimizing the proportion of radiant energy reaching the ground is a simple means of promoting efficient utilization of incident solar radiation. Examples are discussed where advantages acrued from intercropping short- and long-duration species due to enhanced radiation capture over time. Frequent confounding with plant density effects has meant that the evidence for intercropping to enhance radiation capture in space is equivocal. Examples are also presented, demonstrating improved utilization of radiant energy, once intercepted, either by more-efficient production of biomass or increased proportion of biomass partitioned to yield. The potential variety and complexity of intercropping systems, means that recommendations on how to optimise radiation capture and use in intercrops could not readily be determined. Attempts to quantify and predict intercrop performance are examined and dynamic simulation models considered to offer a means by which intercrop performance could be optimised.},

This study takes the initial step of independently validating the STANDARD CERES-Maize simulation model in the semi-arid tropics, and reports some modifications made to improve its performance. The CERES-Maize model did not accurately predict grain-yield of cultivar Dekalb XL82 which was grown over a range of sowing dates and water regimes at Katherine, N.T. Experimental yields (at 15.5% moisture) ranged from 0 to 9840 kg ha−1. Calibration of CERES-Maize reduced the root mean square deviation (rmsd) for observed grain-yields from 3480 to 2015 kg ha−1. Functions describing phenology, leaf growth and senescence, assimilate production and grain growth were revised and validated against field data. The revisions to CERES-Maize not only provide a model more applicable to the semi-arid tropics but also identify the parameters that may require calibration for other maize genotypes and locations in this climatic zone. Further validations of the functions describing nitrogen cycling and rainfall infiltration and runoff are required to increase the model's applicability to risk-analysis studies.},

Adaptation of previously developed crop models has resulted in multiple crop modules in APSIM, which have low scientific transparency and code efficiency. A generic crop model template (GCROP) has been developed to capture unifying physiological principles across crops (plant types) and to provide modular and efficient code for crop modelling. It comprises a standard crop interface to the APSIM engine, a generic crop model structure, a crop process library, and well-structured crop parameter files. The process library contains the major science underpinning the crop models and incorporates generic routines based on physiological principles for growth and development processes that are common across crops. It allows APSIM to simulate different crops using the same set of computer code. The generic model structure and parameter files provide an easy way to test, modify, exchange and compare modelling approaches at process level without necessitating changes in the code. The standard interface generalises the model inputs and outputs, and utilises a standard protocol to communicate with other APSIM modules through the APSIM engine. The crop template serves as a convenient means to test new insights and compare approaches to component modelling, while maintaining a focus on predictive capability. This paper describes and discusses the scientific basis, the design, implementation and future development of the crop template in APSIM. On this basis, we argue that the combination of good software engineering with sound crop science can enhance the rate of advance in crop modelling.},

abstract = {Tillering is an important adaptive feature of pearl millet (Pennisetum americanum L.) to the unpredictable growing conditions of dry areas of the semi-arid tropics. Yet, this feature has largely been ignored in the development of simulation models for pearl millet. The objective of this paper is to parameterise and validate a leaf area module for pearl millet, which dynamically simulates crop leaf area from the leaf area of individual axes through simulating inter-axis competition for light. To derive parameters for the model, four cultivars (contrasting in phenology and tillering habit) were grown under well-watered and well-fertilised conditions across a range of plant densities in three experiments at two locations in India. For selected plants, observations on the number of primary basal tillers and on the number of visible, fully expanded, and senesced leaves on each axis were made twice a week throughout the growing season. Occurrence of panicle initiation (PI) was observed in two experiments only, but data were complemented by published and unpublished data, obtained for comparable cultivars. Parameters were obtained for the time from emergence to \{PI\} as a function of daylength, the leaf initiation rate, the rate of leaf and tiller appearance and the leaf senescence rate; parameters for leaf size were determined in a previous paper. Our parameter estimates compared well with published data and were, with the exception of time to \{PI\} and leaf size, mostly independent of cultivar, axis and density. Genotypic effects on productive tiller number could be attributed to differences in main shoot leaf size. Validation of the leaf area module showed that the module adequately reproduced the effects of density, photoperiod and genotype on the leaf area of individual axes and on productive tiller number. This was despite the fact that the reduction in leaf area of non-productive tillers was achieved in the module through a reduction in leaf size, whereas the crop reduced leaf area through a reduction in leaf number. Our results indicate that \{LAI\} of a tillering crop can be simulated adequately by simulating \{LAI\} from individual leaf area and incorporating the effects of competition for light. }

   abstract = {Background The Ethiopian cereal teff (Eragrostis tef (Zuccagni) Trotter), traditionally grown under short days (11–13 h) (SD), is currently introduced into NW Europe where the early phases of the growing season are characterized by long days (15–17 h) (LD). This paper analyzes to what degree teff's ontogeny and morphology are day length sensitive. Methods To analyze the day length response of teff considering panicle initiation, time to heading, number of phytomers, plant height and biomass, growth chamber and greenhouse experiments were conducted. In these experiments two Ethiopian cultivars, Gibe and Ziquala, and two cultivars from a Dutch breeding programme, Ayana and 04T19, were exposed to day lengths of 9, 10.5, 12, 13.5, 15, 16.5 and 18 h. Key results The Ethiopian cultivars of teff showed a stronger photoperiod response than the Dutch cultivars. For example, time to heading for Ziquala was 88 d under LD but 37 d under SD whereas for Ayana it was 45 d under LD and 29 d under SD. Time to heading could be described using a smooth logistic function consisting of four biologically interpretable parameters. Application of the same function to literature data of the short day plants: rice (Oryza sativa) and soya bean (Glycine max), and the long day plants: wheat (Triticum aestivum) and wild oat (Avena fatua) showed the broader applicability of the approach. Not only panicle initiation of teff, but also development and outgrowth of the panicle were influenced by photoperiod. Plant-to-plant variation in time to heading, the total number of phytomers per shoot, the number of elongated internodes and biomass were higher in LD than in SD treatments for all cultivars. Conclusions This paper provides a detailed description and quantification of the response of teff to day length. The smooth logistic function presented is applicable not only for teff, but also for other short day (rice and soya bean) and long day (wheat and wild oat) species. We revealed, moreover, genetic variation in day length sensitivity, including a strain that showed almost day length neutral behaviour. The ample genetic variation between cultivars suggests there is a basis for breeding for high yielding cultivars for the northern latitudes.},

Traditional methods of soil moisture monitoring have been employed with some success but limitations in utilising them efficiently across both time and space have led to restrictions in their use. An electromagnetic induction (EMI) technique has been evaluated and used to study the patterns of soil water extraction from a Grey Vertosol in fallow or cropped fields alongside a Eucalyptus argophloia windbreak near Warra, Qld (26.93°S, 150.93°E). This technique provides methods for minimising error caused by seasonal variations in temperature and the vertical distributions of both soil water and temperature. The calibration developed in this study was successful in describing the observed variations in total soil moisture in the surface 0.9 m of the soil profile (R2 = 0.93, s.e. = 15.3 mm). We conclude that EMI techniques can provide a quick and efficient means for monitoring soil moisture patterns in agroforestry systems when employed under suitable conditions. This paper describes the techniques developed and where they may be employed, the type of information available from the approach, and the likely methods for employing EMI approaches in a wider range of situations.},

In the medium to low rainfall zones, these plantings can negatively impact upon adjacent agricultural production through competition for soil moisture. The nature of the tree-crop competition zone and the means of managing it have been studied in the main southern cropping zones. However, the differences in soil, climate and agronomic systems in Australia's northern dryland cropping zones could lead to differences in the competition processes and the management options needed to minimise them. In this study, the competition for soil moisture and resultant impacts on crop production were studied for a Eucalyptus argophloia windbreak on a farm near Warra, Queensland (26.938 degrees S, 150.938 degrees E). The results indicate well defined inner and outer competition zones, the extents of which agree with those found elsewhere in Australia and overseas. However, while the extent of the competition is comparable with other regions, local agronomic practices developed for variable climatic conditions and deep clay soils allow trees to extract soil water stored during fallow periods resulting in relatively higher production losses.},

   abstract = {A conceptual framework of the time course of soil water depletion under water limiting conditions was used to quantify water extraction by sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) on a wide range of soil types. The framework takes account of the maximum plant-available soil water content (MAWC) in each layer, the rate at which the soil water extraction front descends through the soil profile (EFV) and the rate of water extraction within each soil layer (kl). Total plant-available soil water for the profile (TPAW) is defined as the sum for all layers of the difference in volumetric soil water between the drained upper limit (theta(u), determined in a separate infiltration experiment) and the lower limit (theta(l), determined at the end of the experiment after water extraction by the crop). To quantify parameter values, soil water content was measured frequently in sunflower crops grown entirely on stored soil moisture. Measurements were made in an environment with high temperature and vapour pressure deficit to determine the potential rate of water extraction. The parameters theta(u), theta(l) and kl were determined for each 20-cm depth increment for each of five soil types. The rate of progression of the soil water extraction front through the profile (EFV) and time at which the extraction front commences its descent (t0) were also determined for each soil type. The framework described actual water extraction on each soil type well. Values for TPAW ranged from 77 to 210 mm for the five soils. This was a result of differences in maximum depth of extraction (EF(max)) and MAWC. Values for MAWC in the surface were related to clay content and were greatest (24%) at clay contents near 55%. On heavy textured soils, MAWC decreased linearly with depth whereas on soils low in clay content it did not change with depth. The decline was caused by an increase in theta(l) with depth. It is possible that preferred root pathways resulted in a lower than expected water extraction at depth and deeper soil layers were consequently not fully exploited. Therefore, values for TPAW are a combination of plant and soil factors. Maximum depth of water extraction (EF(max)) ranged from 80 to 180 cm. The potential EFV across soil types was 3.6 cm day-1. Values of EF(max) related to either crop factors (time to flowering) or soil factors (decline in MAWC). The extraction rate kl increased linearly with clay content of the soil profile. Cumulative water extraction varied among soil types depending on MAWC, EF(max) and kl.},

   abstract = {Integrating belts of woody perennials into Australian farms is proposed as a method of enhancing crop productivity through shelter benefits while addressing natural resource management issues including groundwater recharge. This paper presents yield data from cereal and pulse crops collected from windbreak sites through the eastern agricultural districts of South Australia, using a harvester equipped with a yield monitor. The crop response followed the expected pattern of a competition zone of reduced yield of 1&#x2013;4 tree heights (H) adjacent to the windbreak followed by a shelter benefit zone of unchanged or improved yield extending out to a maximum of 20H. The yield response in the sheltered benefit zone is +3.7% for all cereals (2.2H&#x2013;9.7H) and is +14.0% for all pulse crops (1.7H&#x2013;10.4H). Wheat and barley have similar results, with gains in the shelter benefit zones of 4.1% and 2.1%, respectively, with windbreak competition effects resulting in net yields of 3.0% for wheat and &#x2013;1.1% for barley in the sheltered zones. Faba bean (Vicia faba) shows a strong consistent response to wind shelter, with a yield increase of 19.6% in the shelter benefit zone (1.5H&#x2013;19.6H) and net gain of 19.1% in the sheltered zone (crop edge at 1.0H and extending to 19.6H). The response of cereals to sheltered effects varied across the years of the survey, with net positive results in 1997 (7.4%) and 1999 (7.5%) and close to zero in 1998 and 2000. A theoretical prediction of potential crop yield based on climate for the years of the survey showed that 1997 and 1999 had lower yield potential than 2000 and 1998. This suggests that the climatic conditions occurring during the growing season also influence crop shelter responses. Where cereals are the predominant crop the net yield returns from windbreaks would be small, even if root pruning could be successfully undertaken.},

   abstract = {Components of the water balance of an alley cropping system were measured to assess the extent to which tree rows 30 m apart with access to a fresh, perched watertable at 5 m depth were able to capture deep drainage from an inter-cropped cereal-legume rotation. Neutron probe data showed that the 4-year-old trees, cut back to 0.6-m high at the beginning of the experiment, depleted soil water to 2, 4, and 8 m laterally from the tree rows in their first, second, and third years of coppice regrowth, respectively. Combining data from soil water depletion in summer and comparisons of deuterium: hydrogen ratios of groundwater, xylem sap of trees, and herbaceous plants, it was shown that tagasaste trees drew on soil water for 80% of their transpiration in the first winter and 40% in the second, while switching to near total dependence on groundwater each summer and early autumn. Tree water use on a whole plot basis was 170 mm in 1997 (68% from groundwater) v. 167 mm in 1998 (73% from groundwater). Recharge to the perched watertable was estimated to be 193 mm under sole crop in 1998 (52% of rainfall), reducing to 32 mm when uptake of groundwater by trees was included. The degree of complementarity between tagasaste trees and crops in alley cropping used for water management is quantified for 1998 by calculating the ratio of the distance over which trees reduced drainage to zero to the distance over which they reduced crop yield to zero. It is concluded that segregated monocultures of trees and crops would be a more appropriate strategy than a closely integrated system such as alley cropping in this case.

Leaf area index (LAI) is developed from a thermal time submodel. Phenological development is calculated from the mainstem leaf appearance rate and final leaf number, with the latter determined by responses to daylength and vernalization. Effects of water and N deficits are calculated through their influences on LAI development and radiation use efficiency. The validation of the model using data from independent and near-independent experiments at Lincoln, New Zealand, and Rothamsted, UK, is described. Despite there being no calculation of tiller dynamics or grain number, the model accurately simulated the behaviour of crops exposed to a wide range of conditions. It is concluded that the accurate prediction of phenological development and LAI is much more important for grain yield prediction than are the components of yield. Although grain population is not a necessary step in yield calculation in Sirius, the model proved useful in investigating the effects of stress in setting grain number. The analysis showed that the influence of stress on partitioning of biomass to the spike during pre-anthesis spike growth was much more important in determining grain number than was the effect on biomass accumulation during the same phase.},

   abstract = {The efficiency of crop production is defined in thermodynamic terms as the ratio of energy output (carbohydrate) to energy input (solar radiation). Temperature and water supply are the main climatic constraints on efficiency. Over most of Britain, the radiation and thermal climates are uniform and rainfall is the main discriminant of yield between regions. Total production of dry matter by barley, potatoes, sugar beet, and apples is strongly correlated with intercepted radiation and these crops form carbohydrate at about 1.4 g per MJ solar energy, equivalent to 2.4% efficiency. Crop growth in Britain may therefore be analysed in terms of (a) the amount of light intercepted during the growing season and (b) the efficiency with which intercepted light is used. The amount intercepted depends on the seasonal distribution of leaf area which, in turn, depends on temperature and soil water supply. These variables are discussed in terms of the rate and duration of development phases. A factorial analysis of efficiency shows that the major arable crops in Britain intercept only about 40% of annual solar radiation and their efficiency for supplying energy through economic yield is only about 0.3%. Some of the factors responsible for this figure are well understood and some are immutable. More work is needed to identify the factors responsible for the large differences between average commercial and record yields.},

Field experiments and computer simulations were conducted to understand the effect of supplemental irrigation, type of cultivar and time of sowing (using simulation) on grain yield and quality of two wheat varieties \{EGA\} Gregory and Livingston. There was significant effect of variety and watering regime on grain yield, harvest index, kernel weight and number and protein content. The maximum grain yield of 6.10 t ha−1 was obtained from the irrigated mid-late flowering variety \{EGA\} Gregory in the year the crop was sown early. The effect of irrigation on the late flowering variety \{EGA\} Gregory was higher than that on the early flowering variety Livingston. The grain water use efficiency of \{EGA\} Gregory was higher than that of Livingston in the year it was sown early. \{APSIM\} simulations of yield using historical weather data of the past 114 years show that as the sowing date is delayed, the decrease in yield of \{EGA\} Gregory becomes higher than that of Livingston and by mid-June sowing, the grain yield of Livingston becomes higher than that of \{EGA\} Gregory. As the sowing is delayed, the differences between the anthesis dates, and also grain yields of the two varieties get smaller. The simulation results show that the grain yield of late-sown \{EGA\} Gregory and Livingston increases with the amount of in-crop rainfall. However, when sown early, the yield of Livingston decreases with the amount of in-crop rainfall. Farmers need to have different cultivars on hand and sow according to seasonal condition. An early-sown mid-lateflowering cultivar is less risky. "

However, the region’s insufficient water resources force producers to use deficit irrigation. The present study was conducted to create deficit irrigation strategies for wheat. Twenty two experimental treatments, including full irrigation and dry treatment, were created based on the different growth stages of wheat (stem elongation, heading, milk stage) and water-deficit levels (0, 35, 65 and 100%). The results revealed different effects of water-deficits on wheat yield, quality, and water-use efficiencies based on the plant-growth stages in which the water deficits are applied. The water deficits applied in the stem elongation and heading stages significantly decreased the wheat yields. On the other hand, a 35% deficit applied only in the stem elongation stage yielded the highest thousand-kernel weight and protein ratio. The seasonal water-consumptive use of experimental treatments varied between 206 and 571 mm; the grain yields varied between 288 and 682 kg da−1; the thousand kernel-weights varied between 33.9 and 52.2 g; the total water-use efficiencies varied between 1.02 and 1.30 kg m−3 and irrigation water-use efficiencies varied between 0.51 and 1.17 kg m−3.

A key innovation is change from a core concept of a crop responding to resource supplies to that of a soil responding to weather, management and crops. While this achieves a sound logical structure for improved simulation of soil management and long-term change in the soil resource, it does so without loss of sensitivity in simulating crop yields. This concept is implemented using a program structure in which all modules (e.g. growth of specific crops, soil water, soil N, erosion) communicate with each other only by messages passed via a central `engine'. Using a standard interface design, this design enables easy removal, replacement, or exchange of modules without disruption to the operation of the system. Simulation of crop sequences and multiple crops are achieved by managing connection of crop growth modules to the engine.A shell of software tools has been developed within a WINDOWS environment which includes user-installed editor, linker, compiler, testbed generator, graphics, database and version control software. While the engine and modules are coded in FORTRAN, the Shell is in C++. The resulting product is one in which the functions are coded in the language most familiar to the developers of scientific modules but provides many of the features of object oriented programming. The Shell is written to be aware of UNIX operating systems and be capable of using the processor on UNIX workstations.},

The model was used to simulate above- and belowground growth, grain yield, water and N uptake, and soil water and soil N in wheat crops in Western Australia. Model outputs were compared with detailed field experiments from four rainfall zones, three soil types, and five wheat genotypes. The field experiments covered 10 seasons, with variations in sowing date, plant density, N fertiliser, deep ripping and irrigation. The overall \{APSIM\} model predictions of shoot growth, root depth, water and N uptake, soil water, soil N, drainage and nitrate leaching were found to be acceptable. Grain yields were well predicted with a coefficient of determination r2(1:1)=0.77, despite some underestimation during severe terminal droughts. Yields tended to be underestimated during terminal droughts due to insufficient pre-anthesis stored carbohydrates being remobilised to the grain. Simulation of grain protein, and depth to the perched water table showed limited accuracy when compared with field measurements. In particular, grain protein tended to be overpredicted at high protein levels and underpredicted at low levels. However, specific simulation studies to predict biomass, yield, drainage and nitrate leaching are now possible for wheat crops on the tested soil types and rainfall zones in Western Australia. "

The current study investigated the established doctrine of sowing fast maturing cultivars late, and slow maturing cultivars early. This was explored by quantifying the genotype (G) × environment (E) × management (M) available to farmers using commercially released cultivars, where management relates to the time of sowing. Nineteen cultivars of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum) were sown at 3 times of sowing (early, conventional and late) at 13 sites in 2011 and 2012. Sites were located throughout the Australian grain growing region in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia from latitudes 27°34′S to 35°09′S where annual rainfall ranged from 237 mm to 747 mm. In general, the three way interaction between G, E and M for yield was small and cultivar could not overcome the yield penalty associated with a late time of sowing. At 11 of the 13 sites, fast to moderately fast maturing cultivars sown early generated the highest yields. Fast maturing cultivars sown late could not compensate for a late time of sowing. Commercial cultivars were broadly adapted to environment and management, and with these cultivars, the Australian grain growing region could be split into just two environments, south and north. Even then, season appears to be the main arbiter of environment, rather than location per se as individual sites moved from one group to the other, depending on season. There was no evidence to suggest farmers could exploit a cultivar by management interaction for time of sowing with commercial cultivars, as the outcome of the season is unpredictable, and with current technology farmers should simply choose the best performing cultivar for their region and sow it as early as possible.

abstract = "apsim-Nwheat is a wheat crop system simulation model within the apsim framework which consists of modules that incorporate aspects of soil water, nitrogen, residues, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop development and growth, including grain protein content. apsim-Nwheat has been validated for soil water, soil N, crop phenology, biomass production and yield. However, previous analyses have indicated that model performance was poor in terms of grain protein simulations particularly under very high or very low N input conditions together with terminal drought. The original routine for grain protein content simulated grain protein as a function of independent dry matter and N accumulation into the grain. To constrain grain protein content simulations under very high and very low N input conditions, without effecting other simulations, a simple but physiologically sound link was incorporated between dry matter and N translocation to the grain. An upper boundary of daily protein transfer to the grain was set to 4% N (22.8% grain protein), and a lower boundary was set at 1.23% N (7% grain protein). In addition, grain N was initialised with up to 3% N (17.1% grain protein) at the beginning of the grain filling phase, depending on the availability of tissue N. The new modified grain protein routine was tested across field data sets from a wide range of growing conditions and showed an improved performance with a RMSD, consistent across environments and soil types, at or below 0.35% N (2% grain protein). Independent tests, including data from different climates and a sensitivity analysis confirmed the improved simulation of grain protein under a wide range of conditions. The improved model was found to be reliable and robust enough to be used for specific simulation experiments to study grain protein interactions with management, soil types and environments in different climatic regions.

	abstract = {Dry sowing is the practice of sowing a crop into a dry seed bed before the autumn rains. This is in contrast with the traditional practice of wet sowing where seed is placed into a moist seed bed following a rainfall event in autumn. We evaluated the putative benefits and risks of dry sowing for different soils and locations in Western Australia (WA) using a multi-field (15 or 30 day sowing programmes), multiyear (54 seasons) simulation model analysis with the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator. Importantly our analysis evaluated dry sowing at the farm rather than the field level. Dry sowing has increased in WA, in response to reduced rainfall, increased variation in the timing and amount of autumn rainfall and increased farm areas. Dry sowing is considered beneficial because it can increase yields, make better use of available machinery/labour and decrease heat stress during grain filling due to earlier flowering. Perceived risks of dry sowing include early season water deficit and frost around anthesis. There were large potential yield benefits of up to 35\% with dry sowing compared to wet sowing. The largest yield benefits were for heavy soils, drier locations, and larger cropping programmes. Yield gains were greatest in seasons with low to medium yield potential (300-2500 kg/ha). In seasons with a late start to the opening rains dry sowing brought the sowing date of the last field sown earlier compared with wet sown programmes, with a clear yield benefit for early sowing. Dry sowing also allowed larger farm areas to be sown consistently with equivalent machinery capacity and labour availability. The results highlighted that growing-season (May-Oct) rainfall still set the upper limit to yield but that by practicing dry sowing farms are more likely to yield close to the water-limited benchmark. Dry sown farms produced an average of 350 kg/ha less than the water-limited benchmark and the wet sown cropping programmes 960 kg/ha less. At most sites the risks of a soil water deficit during seedling establishment more than doubled in a dry sown cropping programme compared with wet sowing. Dry sowing resulted in a very small increase (maximum 4\%) in the proportion of crop frosted at anthesis. In contrast, dry sowing markedly reduced the proportion of crop that was exposed to heat events during grain filling. The analysis has demonstrated that single field simulation models can be used to evaluate management strategies applied at the individual field level but that influence whole farm productivity. Dry sowing is an appropriate strategy to manage yield risk by increasing grain yields with a minimal increase of production risks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Object-oriented design (OOD) and programming (OOP) offer many advantages for developing modular crop models. The model structure is well-defined, reuse of code is facilitated through inheritance, and data can be hidden (encapsulated) inside objects that correspond to physical components of the real system, e.g. roots, stems, leaves, or soil layers. However, OOD is best suited to describing the relationship between freely interacting objects, and it has so far been used almost exclusively for modeling simple, discrete and sequential actions. Plant models are not like the automatic teller machine software that is often used in examples of OOD. Plant organs, i.e. objects on the plant, do not wait passively for input from other organs, but they all grow in response to their environment and interact with each other simultaneously and continuously. Also, our ignorance of the processes controlling plant growth forces us to use devices like the limiting factor model to handle these interactions. Many plant models therefore calculate potential growth, limitations imposed by various factors, and then actual growth. In short, there are procedural elements in plant models that do not easily fit an OOD. However, some OOP languages like C+ + allow mixed designs to be implemented, so we have developed a mixed, but mostly object-oriented structure that (1) contains the components familiar in extant procedural designs; (2) can be used for modeling at several levels of complexity; and (3) can be used to model any plant. The mixed procedural/object-oriented design has been implemented in C+ + as a shell using dummy algorithms, and its operation verified. The problems and advantages are discussed.},

For each objective a specific model has to be developed, because the reusability of a model is often limited by the necessity of a fundamental restructuring to adapt it to a different objective. To overcome this limitation, we developed a method to facilitate model restructuring by a novel combination of software technology with expert knowledge. This resulted in the decision-making software application CROSPAL (CROp Simulator: Picking and Assembling Libraries). CROSPAL includes (1) a library of processes each containing different modelling approaches for each crop physiological process and (2) a procedure based on expert knowledge of how to combine the different processes for the objective of the simulation. A brief overview of the state of the art in crop modelling is presented, followed by an account of the developed concept to improve flexibility in crop modelling considering expert knowledge. We describe the design of the software and how expert knowledge is integrated. The use of CROSPAL is illustrated for the modelling of crop phenology. We conclude that CROSPAL is a helpful tool to improve flexibility in crop modelling considering expert knowledge but further development and evaluation is required to extend its range of application to more processes and issues crop modelling is presently addressing.

Our approach utilized information on flowering, physiological maturity and soybean maturity group, and provided a complete set of phenological parameters for APSIM that accounted also for temperature × photoperiod interactions throughout the crop cycle. The model predicted flowering (root mean square error, RMSE = 3.1 d) and physiological maturity (RMSE = 5.5 d) very well in a range of environments across the USA (33–46°N latitude, n = 280). The relative absolute error was below 3\% in all cases indicating the robustness of our approach. The APSIM PLANT phenology module is generic, thus our approach can be applied to all the short-day species included in the modelling platform.},

	abstract = {In recent years, pressure has increased on environmental scientist/modellers to both undertake good science in an efficient and timely manner, under increasing resource constraints, and also to ensure that the science being performed is immediately relevant to a particular environmental management context. At the same time, environmental management is changing, with increasing requirements for multi-scale and multi-objective assessment and decision making that considers economic and social systems, as well as the ecosystem. Integration of management activities, and also of the modelling undertaken to support management, has become a high priority. To solve the problems of application and integration, knowledge encapsulation in models is being undertaken in a way that both meets the needs for good science, and also provides the conceptual and technical structures required for broader and more integrated application of that knowledge by managers. To support this modelling, tools and technologies from computer science and software engineering are being transferred to applied environmental science fields, and a range of new modelling and software development approaches are being pursued. The papers in this Special Issue provide examples of the integrated modelling concepts and applications that have been, or are being, developed. These include the use of object-oriented concepts, component-based modelling techniques and modelling frameworks, as well as the emerging use of integrated modelling platforms and metadata support for modelling semantics. This paper provides an overview of the science and management imperatives underlying recent developments, discusses the technological and conceptual developments that have taken place, and highlights some of the semantic, operational and process requirements that need to be addressed now that the technological aspects of integrated modelling are well advanced.},

	abstract = {Integrated modelling has arisen as a valuable tool for assisting environmental management. Many existing land and water resources models are, however, not amenable to integration. To transform and develop models that serve integrated environmental management we need to address technical and social issues that include model reformulation and design, adoption of standard specification, notation and documentation on models and the reluctance of developers to adopt new design and programming approaches. There are tools and approaches that can aid the adoption of new approaches, and these are reviewed in the paper. Other developments that need to be infiltrated into the modelling community include facilities to flexibly examine, edit, visualise and analyse data at all stages of program execution, processes for user involvement in program and interface design, tools to assist knowledge-based selection of models and processes for undertaking and recording the peer reviewing of models. Options to address these issues are discussed, and it is considered that, despite the availability of suitable tools, the likelihood of getting adoption of high quality software engineering along with appropriate documentation and design practices will be low unless an integrated development approach is made, and the benefits made apparent to both developers and users. Context abstract: recent moves towards more integrated management of land and water resources have resulted in an increased focus on model integration. This focus has included the redesign of existing models to increase their capacity for reuse, often by using object-oriented approaches to produce flexible and reusable program modules. The redesign of existing models, as well as the design of new models, has, ideally, being done in a way that allows the program modules to be easily linked and run together. The adoption of sound software engineering practices, including the use of formalised modelling languages and modular development, is helping to achieve the goal of producing natural resources management modelling tool kits that allow complex, module-based, programs to be developed through drag-and-drop environments. Beyond software engineering there lie a number of issues that must be considered before the advantages of drag-and-drop integrated environmental modelling become apparent to natural resources managers and planners. These issues, including model design, notation, documentation and review, are discussed.},

	abstract = {Of concern to the environmental modelling community is the proliferation of individual, and individualistic, models and the time associated with common model development tasks such as data transformation, coding of models, and visualisation. One way of addressing this problem is the adoption of modelling frameworks. These frameworks, or environments, support modular model development through provision of libraries of core environmental modelling modules, as well as reusable tools for data manipulation, analysis and visualisation. Such frameworks have a range of features and requirements related to the architecture, protocols and methods of operation, and it is difficult to compare the modelling workload and performance of alternative frameworks without using them to undertake identical, or similar modelling tasks. This paper describes the outcomes of a workshop to compare three frameworks - the Spatial Modelling Environment (SME), Tarsier and the Integrated Component Modelling System (ICMS). A simple environmental problem linking hillslope flow and soil erosion processes with a receiving water store was designed and then implemented in the three frameworks. It was found that the SME and Tarsier contained many components well suited to handling complex spatial and temporal models, with ICMS being an integrated framework tailored for smaller scale problems. Of the three tested frameworks, the SME proved superior in supporting problem description, Tarsier provided more flexibility in linking and validating the model components, and ICMS served as an effective prototyping tool. The test problem, and associated data and parameters, are described in detail to allow others to undertake this test.},

	abstract = {The cropping systems simulation model APSIM-Nwheat was tested against detailed field measurements representing possible growing conditions under future climate change scenarios. Increasing average temperatures by 1.7 degreesC observed over several seasons at Obregon, Mexico reduced the time to flowering by 11 days and resulted in a decline of total biomass and grain yield. These effects were reproduced by the model, except when the observed total biomass inexplicably rose again in the fourth and fifth year, despite higher temperature and a much shorter growing time. In a water stress experiment, the effects of different timing and duration of water deficit on crop growth and yield were reproduced with the model for a rain-shelter experiment at Lincoln, New Zealand where observed grain yields were reduced from 10 to 4 t ha(-1) due to increased water deficit. In experiments from Western Australia, reduced growth and yields due to extreme terminal water deficit were also reproduced with the model where measured yields fall below 0.5 t ha(-1). In the Maricopa Free Air Carbon-Dioxide Enrichment (FACE) experiment in Arizona, USA, the largest yield increase occurred with elevated CO2 in the dry and high N treatments, whereas little or no response was observed in the wet and low N supply treatments, as simulated with the model. Combining elevated CO2 with increased temperature in a sensitivity analysis, two levels of water supply and a range of N applications indicated a positive effect of elevated CO2 on yield as long as N was not limiting growth. Increased temperature and reduced water supply reduced yields and the yield response to N supply under ambient and elevated CO2. Grain protein concentrations were reduced under elevated CO2, but the difference was minor with ample N fertiliser. Evapotranspiration was reduced under elevated CO2. Higher temperatures increased evapotranspiration with low N input, but reduced it with ample N fertiliser, resulting in a reduction and an increase, respectively, in drainage below the root zone. In the Mediterranean environment of Western Australia the impact of elevated CO2 and increased temperature on grain yield was in average positive, but varied with seasonal rainfall distribution. Based on the range of model testing experiments and the sensitivity analysis, APSIM-Nwheat was found suitable for studies on directional impacts of future climate change on wheat production. Due to some large discrepancies between simulated and observed data, field experiments representing only a limited range of possible climate change scenarios and the large possible range of factorial interactions not tested, simulated quantitative effects with the model should be interpreted cautiously.

	abstract = {As a result of climate change, and in particular rainfall changes, agricultural production is likely to change across the globe. Until now most research has focused on areas which will become unsustainable for agricultural production. However, there are also regions where climate change might actually improve conditions for growth. In the western Pampas region of Argentina, average annual rainfall has increased by 100-200 mm over the last 70 years, mainly during summer. Wheat is grown during winter, primarily on stored soil water and the main factor limiting plant production in this area is rainfall. Using the well tested simulation model APSIM-NWheat, we studied whether recent climate change has potentially opened new opportunities for wheat cropping in Argentina. Simulation results indicated that the additional rainfall in the Pampas of Argentina has increased the achievable yield (defined as the yield limited by solar radiation, temperature, water and nitrogen supply) of wheat in the currently cropped region, but less than expected based on the large amount of additional rainfall. The higher achievable yield from additional rainfall could potentially allow an expansion of profitable wheat cropping into currently non-cropped areas, where the achievable wheat yield increased in average from 1 t/ha to currently 2 t/ha. However, the poor water-holding capacity of the sandy soils which dominate the region outside the current cropping area limits the systems ability to use most of the increased summer rainfall. Nevertheless, the current higher achievable yield indicates a suitability of the region for cropping, which will slightly decline or remain unchanged depending on summer rainfall storage, with current and future climate change, including projected changes in rainfall, temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration. Factors other than just the achievable yield will eventually influence any future development of this region for cropping, including the high sensitivity of the sandy soils to erosion and nutrient leaching, current relatively high land prices, restrictions on clearing for cropping, the distance to the nearest port and current unsuitable cultivars withstanding the high frost risk.},

The objectives of this research were: (1) to investigate the farm economic net return of three conservation tillage practices (NIT – Non-Inversion Tillage, MT – Minimum Tillage and NT – No-Tillage) performed at variable intensity within predefined management zones; the HS – area with a consistently higher yield and LS – area with a consistently low yield, of a maize (Zea mays, L.) field in NE-Italy (2) to identify the most economically sound tillage practice for each management zone using long-term simulation results; (3) to assess the environmental impact of the three tillage systems with regards to soil organic carbon changes, CO2 losses and nitrate leaching using the SALUS model. Field trials were carried out on an 8-ha flat field, situated near Rovigo, NE Italy, on maize (Z. mays, L.). The farm gross margin was higher for NT in the year of study as well as the long-term simulated scenarios that resulted in higher yields over time. The NT tillage practices resulted in higher economic return in the both the HS and LS areas. Total soil carbon was higher in NT due to the crop residues retained on the surface. Nitrate leaching was higher in for the MT and for the LS area.},

	abstract = {Triticale often out-yields wheat in both favourable and unfavourable growing conditions. Observed traits suggested for the higher yields in triticale include greater early vigour, a longer spike formation phase with same duration to flowering, reduced tillering, increased remobilization of carbohydrates to the grain, early vigorous root growth and higher transpiration use efficiency. To quantify the impact of these traits systematically across seasons and contrasting rainfall regions and soil types, these triticale traits were introduced into a wheat model (APSIM-Nwheat). The impact of each individual trait and their full combination was analysed in a simulation experiment for three Mediterranean growing environments, two contrasting soil types and long-term historical weather data. The simulated impact of these traits was compared with measured impacts from a range of field experiments across several environments. Simulated responses of various crop characteristics including yield, were in general similar to responses observed in wheat-triticale comparison field experiments across a large range of growing conditions. The simulation analysis indicated that the yield response to the incorporation of the triticale traits into wheat was positive, in both low and high yielding growing conditions, similar to measured differences, but the simulated benefit was on average lower than the range observed in data of triticale and wheat. This suggests that other traits might also be involved in higher-yielding triticale, or the magnitude of some of the traits may be underestimated in field experiments due to 'trait by environment' interactions. The simulation results suggest the highest yield benefit can be achieved from increasing transpiration use efficiency in wheat, but early vigour, remobilization of stem carbohydrates and early root growth also contribute positively to a yield increase in the different growing environments. The yield benefits from the triticale traits increased in the future climate change scenario in particular on soils with high water-holding capacity from contributions of increased early vigour, remobilization of stem carbohydrates and transpiration use efficiency, and remained stable on the lighter soils.

	abstract = {Failing grain crops are sometimes sacrificed for grazing by mixed farmers, a decision involving a complex range of factors. This simulation study used two APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator)-based approaches to investigate the circumstances under which more revenue might be obtained by sacrificing a wheat crop for grazing rather than harvesting it for grain in Western Australia’s grainbelt. First, we developed a simple partial budget calculation to estimate and compare revenue from grain or grazing alternatives using data for grain yield and standing biomass at flowering. This was simulated for a factorial of soil types and locations varying in mean annual rainfall. We then simulated wheat quality and livestock production on spring wheat grazed at different stages of crop development and at a range of stocking rates. Dynamic simulations of grazing showed that livestock production increased as grazing was delayed; stocking rate had little impact at this time. Grazing earlier necessitated lighter stocking rates but surprisingly had little benefit for animal performance. Partial budgets showed that under average commodity prices, grazing a wheat crop could be more profitable 40–75\% of the time on poorer soil types in lower rainfall environments. In these situations, by tactically grazing when grain yield is below a critical level economic returns could be increased by more than A\$50/ha in 30–40\% of years and over the long term average revenues could be increased by A\$30/ha.year. This critical grain yield ranged from 1.3 to 1.7 t/ha on shallow gravel soil and 1.9 to 2.2 t/ha on a deep sand. In higher rainfall environments and on better soil types grazing was rarely a better option unless livestock prices were high relative to grain. This approach, combining crop simulation with partial budgets, was useful for developing simple management rules for a complex system. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that making tactical use of a wheat crop for forage in situations with low grain yield prospects is a major opportunity to increase profitability and help respond to climate variability in mixed farms in many areas of the Western Australian wheatbelt.},

In practice environmental modelling requires the use and implementation of workflows that combine several methods, tailored to the model purpose and dependent upon the data and information available. A five-step procedure for performance evaluation of models is suggested, with the key elements including: (i) (re)assessment of the model's aim, scale and scope; (ii) characterisation of the data for calibration and testing; (iii) visual and other analysis to detect under- or non-modelled behaviour and to gain an overview of overall performance; (iv) selection of basic performance criteria; and (v) consideration of more advanced methods to handle problems such as systematic divergence between modelled and observed values.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This chapter aims at presenting the overall concept and method of integrated impact assessment as implemented in the 'SEAMLESS-Integrated Framework' with its graphical user interface. Methodology/approach: The chapter uses an application of studying ex-ante impacts of trade liberalization policies to illustrate the way the system operates when several individual models are seamlessly connected. These models originate from different domains and operate at different levels of analysis (market, farm, field). The chain of models which was developed within the SEAMLESS project assesses three scenarios which differ in the rates of import tariff reduction. To ensure the integration of three domains of sustainable development, the different scenarios are assessed in terms of economic, environmental and social indicators. Findings: For the economic side, we find a total welfare increase for the EU as a whole in all scenarios, whereas gains or losses relative to the EU average vary by country. When focusing on farm type level we find that all farm types experience losses in income mostly due to the tariff reduction component of the trade liberalization scenarios, but effects differ among farm types. For the environmental side, there is no apparent overall effect of the trade policies on nitrate leaching, although this differs between regions. For the social side, a small negative effect on agricultural employment is observed in regions, countries and EU as a whole. Practical implications: The diversity that is found in the three scenarios of trade liberalization in terms of impact on economic, environmental and social indicators across countries, regions, farm types calls for further explorations of additional (regional) policies with SEAMLESS-IF which could modify the impacts of trade liberalization for example on labour demand or local nitrate leaching. For this and other applications, the system provides ample opportunities to re-run scenarios thereby searching for a combination of policies at different levels to achieve different policy objectives in the economic, environmental and social domain.},

	abstract = {At present, stakeholders wishing to develop land use and management change scenarios at the landscape scale and to assess their corresponding impacts on water quality, biodiversity and economic performance, must examine the output of a suite of separate models. The process is not simple and presents a considerable deterrent to making such comparisons and impedes the development of more sustainable, multifunctional landscapes. To remedy this problem, we developed the Landscapes Toolkit, an integrated modelling framework that assists natural resource managers, policy-makers, planners and local communities explore options for sustainable landscape development. The Landscapes Toolkit links spatially-explicit disciplinary models, to enable integrated assessment of the water quality, biodiversity and economic outcomes of stakeholder-defined land use and management change scenarios. We use the Tully-Murray catchment in the Great Barrier Reef region of Australia as a case study to illustrate the development and application of the Landscapes Toolkit. Results show that the Landscapes Toolkit strikes a satisfactory balance between the inclusion of component models that sufficiently capture the richness of some key aspects of social-ecological system processes and the need for stakeholders to understand and compare the results of the different models. The latter is a prerequisite to making more informed decisions about sustainable landscape development. The flexibility of being able to add additional models and to update existing models is a particular strength of the Landscapes Toolkit design. Hence, the Landscapes Toolkit offers a promising modelling framework for supporting social learning and adaptive management through participatory scenario development and evaluation as well as being a tool to guide planning and policy discussions at the landscape scale.},

	abstract = {stics is a model that has been developed at INRA (France) since 1996. It simulates crop growth as well as soil water and nitrogen balances driven by daily climatic data. It calculates both agricultural variables (yield, input consumption) and environmental variables (water and nitrogen losses). From a conceptual point of view, stics relies essentially on well-known relationships or on simplifications of existing models. One of the key elements of stics is its adaptability to various crops. This is achieved by the use of generic parameters relevant for most crops and on options in the model formalisations concerning both physiology and management, that have to be chosen for each crop. All the users of the model form a group that participates in making the model and the software evolve, because stics is not a fixed model but rather an interactive modelling platform. This article presents version 5.0 by giving details on the model formalisations concerning shoot ecophysiology, soil functioning in interaction with roots, and relationships between crop management and the soil-crop system. The data required to run the model relate to climate, soil (water and nitrogen initial profiles and permanent soil features) and crop management. The species and varietal parameters are provided by the specialists of each species. The data required to validate the model relate to the agronomic or environmental outputs at the end of the cropping season. Some examples of validation and application are given, demonstrating the generality of the stics model and its ability to adapt to a wide range of agro-environmental issues. Finally, the conceptual limits of the model are discussed.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Plant Modelling Framework (PMF) is a software framework for creating models that represent the plant components of farm system models in the agricultural production system simulator (APSIM). It is the next step in the evolution of generic crop templates for APSIM, building on software and science lessons from past versions and capitalising on new software approaches. The PMF contains a top-level Plant class that provides an interface with the APSIM model environment and controls the other classes in the plant model. Other classes include mid-level Organ, Phenology, Structure and Arbitrator classes that represent specific elements or processes of the crop and sub-classes that the mid-level classes use to represent repeated data structures. It also contains low-level Function classes which represent generic mathematical, logical, procedural or reference code and provide values to the processes carried out by mid-level classes. A plant configuration file specifies which mid-level and Function classes are to be included and how they are to be arranged and parameterised to represent a particular crop model. The PMF has an integrated design environment to allow plant models to be created visually. The aims of the PMF are to maximise code reuse and allow flexibility in the structure of models. Four examples are included to demonstrate the flexibility of application of the PMF; 1. Slurp, a simple model of the water use of a static crop, 2. Oat, an annual grain crop model with detailed growth, development and resource use processes, 3. Lucerne, perennial forage model with detailed growth, development and resource use processes, 4. Wheat, another detailed annual crop model constructed using an alternative set of organ and process classes. These examples show the PMF can be used to develop models of different complexities and allows flexibility in the approach for implementing crop physiology concepts into model set up.},

	abstract = {Developing a relationship between pest abundance and damage to crops is essential for the calculation of economic injury levels (EIL) leading to informed management decisions. The crop modelling framework, APSIM, was used to simulate the impact of mouse damage on yield loss on wheat where a long-term dataset on the density of mice was available (1983-2003). The model was calibrated using results from field trials where wheat plants were hand clipped to imitate mouse damage. The grazing effect of mice was estimated using the population density, daily intake per mouse and the proportion of wheat grain and plant tissue in the diet to determine yield loss. The mean yield loss caused by mice was 12.4\% (±5.4S.E.; range -0.5 to 96\%). There were 7/21 years when yield loss was {\textgreater}5\%. A damage/abundance relationship was constructed and a sigmoidal curve explained 97\% of variation when accounting for different trajectories of mouse densities from sowing to harvest. The majority of damage occurred around emergence of the crop when mouse densities were {\textgreater}100miceha-1. This is the first time that field data on mouse density and a crop simulation model have been combined to estimate yield loss. The model examines the efficacy of baiting and how to estimate EILs. Because the broadscale application of zinc phosphide is cheap and effective, the EIL is very low ({\textless}1\% yield loss). The APSIM model is highly flexible and could be used for other vertebrate pests in a range of crops or pastures to develop density/damage relationships and to assist with management.},

	abstract = {This study presents the use of a whole farm model in a participatory modelling research approach to examine the sensitivity of four contrasting case study farms to a likely climate change scenario. The newly generated information was used to support discussions with the participating farmers in the search for options to design more profitable and sustainable farming systems in Queensland Australia. The four case studies contrasted in key systems characteristics: opportunism in decision making, i.e. flexible versus rigid crop rotations; function, i.e. production of livestock or crops; and level of intensification, i.e. dryland versus irrigated agriculture. Tested tactical and strategic changes under a baseline and climate change scenario (CCS) involved changes in the allocation of land between cropping and grazing enterprises, alternative allocations of limited irrigation water across cropping enterprises, and different management rules for planting wheat and sorghum in rainfed cropping. The results show that expected impacts from a likely climate change scenario were evident in the following increasing order: the irrigated cropping farm case study, the cropping and grazing farm, the more opportunistic rainfed cropping farm and the least opportunistic rainfed cropping farm. We concluded that in most cases the participating farmers were operating close to the efficiency frontier (i.e. in the relationship between profits and risks). This indicated that options to adapt to climate change might need to evolve from investments in the development of more innovative cropping and grazing systems and/or transformational changes on existing farming systems. We expect that even though assimilating expected changes in climate seems to be rather intangible and premature for these farmers, as innovations are developed, adaptation is likely to follow quickly. The multiple interactions among farm management components in complex and dynamic farm businesses operating in a variable and changing climate, make the use of whole farm participatory modelling approaches valuable tools to quantify benefits and trade-offs from alternative farming systems designs in the search for improved profitability and resilience.},

	abstract = {FARMSCAPE (Farmers', Advisers', Researchers', Monitoring, Simulation, Communication And Performance Evaluation) is a program of participatory research with the farming community of northeast Australia. It initially involved research to explore whether farmers and their advisers could gain benefit from tools such as soil characterisation and sampling, climate forecasts and, in particular, simulation modelling. Its current focus is facilitating the implementation of commercial delivery systems for these same tools, in order to meet industry demand for-their access. This paper presents the story of what was' done over the past decade, it provides performance indicators of impact, it reflects on what was learnt over this period and it outlines where this research is likely to head in the future. Over the past 10 years, the FARMSCAPE team employed a Participatory Action Research approach to explore whether farmers could value simulation as a decision support tool for managing their farming system and if so, could it be delivered cost-effectively. Through farmer group engagement, on-farm trials, soil characterisation, monitoring of crops, soils and climate, and sessions to apply the APSIM systems simulator, FARMSCAPE represented a research program on decision support intervention. Initial scepticism by farmers and commercial consultants about the value of APSIM was addressed by testing its performance both against measured data from on-farm trials and against farmers' experiences with past commercial crops. Once this credibility check was passed, simulation sessions usually evolved into participants interactively inquiring of the model the consequence of alternative management options. These 'What if' questions using APSIM were contextualised using local climate and soil data and the farmer's actual or proposed management rules. The active participation of farmers and their advisers, and working in the context of their own farming operations, were the key ingredients in the design, implementation and interpretation of the FARMSCAPE approach to decision support. The attraction of the APSIM systems simulator to farmers contemplating change was that it allowed them to explore their own system in a manner equivalent to learning from experience. To achieve this, APSIM had to be credible and flexible. While direct engagement of farmers initially enabled only a limited number of beneficiaries, this approach generated a commercial market for timely and high quality interactions based on soil monitoring and simulation amongst a significant sector of the farming community. Current efforts are therefore focused on the training, support and accreditation of commercial agronomists in the application of the FARMSCAPE approach and tools. The FARMSCAPE approach to decision support has come to represent an approach to guiding science-based engagement with farm decision making which is being tested nationally and internationally.

This study was conducted to investigate the effects of the interannual variability and trends in temperature, solar radiation and precipitation during 1961-2003 on wheat and maize yields in a double cropping system at Beijing and Zhengzhou in the North China Plain (NCP), and to examine the relative contributions of each climate variable in isolation. 129 climate scenarios consisting of all the combinations of these climate variables were constructed. Each scenario contained 43 years of observed values of one variable, combined with values of the other two variables from each individual year repeated 43 times. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) was used to simulate crop yields using the ensemble of generated climate scenarios. The results showed that the warming trend during the study period did not have significant impact on wheat yield potential at both sites, and only had significant negative impact on maize yield potential at Beijing. This is in contrast with previous results on effect of warming. The decreasing trend in solar radiation had a much greater impact on simulated yields of both wheat and maize crops, causing a significant reduction in potential yield of wheat and maize at Beijing. Although decreasing trends in rainfed yield of both simulated wheat and maize were found, the substantial interannual variability of precipitation made the trends less prominent.},

A significant decline in radiation and rainfall was detected during the 43 years, while both temperature and FDR exhibit an increasing trend in both wheat and maize seasons. The average trend of each climatic variable for each crop season from the four sites is that radiation decreased by 13.2 and 6.2 MJ m(-2) a(-1), precipitation decreased by 0.1 and 1.8 mm a(-1), minimum temperature increased by 0.05 and 0.02A degrees C a(-1), maximum temperature increased by 0.03 and 0.01A degrees C a(-1), FDR increased by 0.21 and 0.38\% a(-1) during wheat and maize season, respectively. Simulated crop water demand and potential yield was significantly decreased because of the declining trend in solar radiation. On average, crop water demand was decreased by 2.3 mm a(-1) for wheat and 1.8 mm a(-1) for maize if changes in crop variety were not considered. Simulated potential crop yields under fully irrigated condition declined about 45.3 kg ha(-1) a(-1) for wheat and 51.4 kg ha(-1) a(-1) for maize at the northern sites, Beijing and Tianjin. They had no significant changes in the southern sites, Jinan and Zhengzhou. Irrigation, fertilization development and crop variety improvement are main factors to contribute to the increase in actual crop yield for the wheat-maize double cropping system, contrasted to the decline in the potential crop yield. Further research on how the improvement in crop varieties and management practices can counteract the impact of climatic change may provide insight into the future sustainability of wheat-maize double crop rotations in the NCP.},

	abstract = {The Generic Plant Simulator (GePSi) is a physiologically-based model that combines modules for canopy, root environment, water relations, and potential growth to generate whole-plant carbon, nitrogen, and water balances. The version presented here is coded in the object-oriented programming (OOP) language, C+ +, to enhance the implementation of modularity. In the aboveground aerial environment, the Weather module defines the weather conditions above a canopy, and MicroWeather defines the vertical profiles of micro-meteorological variables in a canopy. The belowground soil environment contains the SoilProperty modules, which define vertical profiles of physical and chemical variables in a soil column. The `part-of' hierarchy in GePSi follows the structure of a real plant: the Plant module calls canopy and root system modules; the Canopy module, in turn, calls leaf, stem and fruit modules; and the RootSystem module calls coarse and fine root modules, etc. Our long-term goal is for GePSi to serve as a template for building a plant growth simulator by simply selecting appropriate modules for the question being asked. We are building a suite of plant modules (and their interfaces) based on general principles that are fundamentally similar for different kinds of plants. This includes photosynthesis, growth, nutrient and carbon allocation, water uptake, etc. These modules can be parameterized for specific species, related groups of species, life-forms, or broader groups depending on how variable the processes are across the groupings and the amount of unexplained variability that is acceptable for the question being investigated. Our modular-based approach has numerous advantages, including improving the understanding of the model, reducing duplication of effort, and facilitating the adaptation of the model for different sites and ecosystems.},

a promising technology for reducing N losses from

to determine best practice for DCD, synthesising the
available knowledge. The APSIM model, with a newly
developed module for nitrification inhibition, was used
to investigate the role of DCD on N leaching. The
model is sensitive to various environmental conditions
(soil and climate) and management options (timing and
application rate). The model satisfactorily described
results from lysimeter experiments which showed that
DCD reduced nitrate leaching by 25-50\%, depending
on soil and environmental conditions. The model was
used to evaluate the effectiveness of DCD applications
in different months and with different periods between
urine and DCD applications. It is shown that DCD
effectiveness in highest on winter and a lag between
urine deposition and DCD application can greatly
reduce the effect of DCD especially in summer. The
model is a promising tool for determining DCD
effectiveness under various conditions and for aiding
the development of best management practices.},

	abstract = {Modelling water and solute transport through soil requires the characterisation of the soil hydraulic functions; however, determining these functions based on measurements is time-consuming and costly. Pedotransfer functions (PTFs), which make use of easily measurable soil properties to predict the hydraulic functions, have been proposed as an alternative to measurements. The better known and more widely used PTFs were developed in the USA or Europe, where large datasets exist. No specific PTFs have been published for New Zealand soils. To address this gap, we evaluated a range of published PTFs against an available dataset comprising a range of different soils from New Zealand and selected the best PTFs to construct an ensemble PTF (ePTF). Assessment (and adjustment when required) of published PTFs was done by comparing measurements and estimates of soil water content and the hydraulic conductivity at selected matric suction values. For each point, the best two or three PTFs were chosen to compose the ePTF, with correcting constants if needed. The outputs of the ePTF are the hydraulic properties at selected matric suctions, akin to obtaining measurements, thus allowing the fit of different equations as well as combining any available measurements. Testing of the ePTF showed promising performance, with reasonably accurate estimates of the water retention of an independent dataset. Root mean square error values averaged 0.06 m3 m–3 for various New Zealand soils, which is within the accuracy level of published PTF studies. The largest errors were found for soils with high clay content, for which the ePTF should be used with care. The performance of the ePTF for estimating soil hydraulic conductivity was not as reliable as for water content, exhibiting large scatter. Predictions of saturated hydraulic conductivity were of the same magnitude as the measurements, whereas the unsaturated values were generally under-predicted. The conductivity data available for this study were limited and highly variable. The estimates for hydraulic conductivity should therefore be used with much care, and future research should address measurements and analysis to improve the predictions. The ePTF was also used to parameterise the SWIM soil module for use in Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) simulations. Comparisons of drainage predicted by APSIM against results from lysimeter experiments suggest that the use of the derived ePTF is suited for the estimation of soil parameters for use in modelling. The ePTF is not envisaged as a substitute for measurements but is a useful tool to complement datasets with limited amounts of measured data.},

GrassGro simulates pasture and animal production using a wide range of pasture species and sheep and cattle enterprises. Data from the Temperate Pasture Sustainability Key Program grazing management sites were used to validate the predictions of GrassGro. The pasture and animal production from a diverse range of sites were successfully simulated. Limitations of GrassGro were identified (parameter sets not available for some pasture species, inability to simulate clumpy swards, rudimentary interspecies competition model) and some improvements were made to its performance (improved species parameter sets and improved modeling of rooting depth). Recommendations are made on priority areas of research to improve GrassGro and on improvements in methodology which could be adopted by future programs like Temperate Pasture Sustainability Key Program.},

	abstract = {Declining soil organic matter levels because of cropping have been shown to reduce crop growth and yield, but the effects of changing infiltration and soil hydraulic properties on crop productivity have not been widely evaluated. Cropping systems in south-eastern Queensland have, in the past, involved intense tillage, trafficking with heavy machinery, and changed organic matter cycling, affecting soil aggregation, permeability, water-holding characteristics, and organic matter. The aim of this paper is to determine how important infiltration and soil hydraulic condition has been to the water balance, crop growth, and yield in the past, and may be in the future if management is not changed. Change in physical and chemical condition of the 5 most commonly cropped soils in south-east Queensland (Sodosols, Vertosols with \&\#x2264;55\% clay, Vertosols with \&\#62;55\% clay, Red Ferrosols and Red Chromosols/Kandosols) was measured over 0\&\#8211;70 years of cropping and estimated up to 200 years. The APSIM model was used to predict effects of changing soil condition in a rain-fed, fertilised, wheat-summer fallow cropping system with intense tillage. Decline in infiltration, restricted internal redistribution of water, and increased evaporation reduced water supply to the crop, causing simulated yield to decline by 29, 38, 25, 17, and 13\% for the 5 soils, respectively, after 50 years of cropping. Gross margin declined at a faster rate, falling by 36, 50, 40, 20, and 21\%, respectively after 50 years because of increasing fertiliser requirement to compensate for declining soil fertility. Crop productivity on most soils continued to steadily decline as period of cropping increased to 200 years. To arrest or reverse this downward trend, it is likely that substantial changes to current cropping systems will be needed, including reducing tillage and trafficking, and improving organic matter levels.},

	abstract = {While mechanistic models tend to be detailed, they are less detailed than the real systems they seek to describe, so judgements are being made about the appropriate level of detail within the process of model development. These judgements are difficult to test, consequently it is easy for models to become over-parameterised, potentially increasing uncertainty in predictions. The work we describe is a step towards addressing these difficulties. We propose and implement a method which explores a family of simpler models obtained by replacing model variables with constants (model reduction by variable replacement). The procedure iteratively searches the simpler model formulations and compares models in terms of their ability to predict observed data, evaluated within a Bayesian framework. The results can be summarised as posterior model probabilities and replacement probabilities for individual variables which lend themselves to mechanistic interpretation. This provides powerful diagnostic information to support model development, and can identify areas of model over-parameterisation with implications for interpretation of model results. We present the application of the method to 3 example models. In each case reduced models are identified which outperform the original full model in terms of comparisons to observations, suggesting some over-parameterisation has occurred during model development. We argue that the proposed approach is relevant to anyone involved in the development or use of process based mathematical models, especially those where understanding is encoded via empirically based relationships.

The treatments were (i) grass + legume leys (purple pigeon grass, Setaria incrassata; Rhodes grass, Chloris gayana; lucerne, Medicago sativa; annual medics, M. scutellata and M. truncatula) of 4 years duration followed by continuous wheat; (ii) 2-year rotation of annual medics and wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Hartog); (iii) 2-year rotation of lucerne and wheat; (iv) 2-year rotation of chickpea (Cicer arietinum cv. Barwon) and wheat; (v) no-tillage (NT) wheat; and (vi) conventional tillage (CT) wheat. Fertiliser N as urea was applied to both NT wheat and CT wheat at 0,25, and 75 kg N/ha. year. The CT wheat also received N at 12.5 and 25kg N/ha. year. After 4 years, soil organic carbon (C) concentration under grass + legume leys increased by 20\% (650 kg C/ha. year) relative to that under continuous CT wheat. Soil total N increased by 11, 18, and 22\% after 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively, under grass + legume leys relative to continuous CT wheat. These increases in soil organic matter were mostly confined to the 0-2.5 cm layer. After the start of wheat cropping, organic C and total N levels declined steadily but were still higher than under CT wheat and higher than initial values in December 1985. Although 2-year rotations of lucerne-wheat and medic-wheat had a small effect on soil organic C, soil total N concentrations were higher than in the chickpea-wheat rotation and continuous CT wheat from November 1990 to November 1992. Soil under chickpea-wheat rotation had organic C and total N concentrations similar to continuous CT wheat, although from the former, about 70 kg/ha. year of extra N was removed in the grain from 1989 to 1993. No-tillage practice had a small effect on soil organic C, although total N concentration was higher than under CT wheat in November 1993. These effects were mainly confined to the surface 0-2.5 cm depth. The C to N ratio was only affected in soil under grass + legume leys, and no-tillage treatments. These data show that restoration of soil organic matter in Vertisol requires grass + legume leys, primarily due to increased root biomass, although soil total N can be enhanced by including legume leys for longer duration in cropping systems in the semi-arid and subtropical environment.},

FARMSCAPE intervention has offered enhanced soil characterisation and monitoring as a contribution to soil water and nitrogen inventory, and simulation as a contribution to interpretation of locally measured environmental data in stochastic production terms. This paper relates the journey taken by the farmers, their consultants, and the researchers as they worked together to assess the value to farming and consulting practice of these scientific tools and techniques. Ten years after FARMSCAPE interactions commenced, a sample of participant farmers and consultants was interviewed to evaluate effects on thinking and practice. Understandings and concepts gained in FARMSCAPE continued to guide thinking and action. Early simulations in response to \&\#x2018;what if...?' enquiries of strategic importance, such as crop sequencing and rotation choice, were still referred to as learnings of continuing value. However, techniques and practices varied markedly between individuals and organisations. Monitoring of soil resources varied from continued use of the relatively complex tools and techniques provided by the researchers through to the use of much-simplified techniques that provided adequate information to satisfy the conceptual models. Methods for interpreting soil water ranged from use of the simulator, APSIM, to simple water-use efficiency \&\#x2018;rules of thumb'.},

	abstract = {Models that implement the bio-physical components of agro-ecosystems are ideally suited for exploring sustainability issues in cropping systems. Sustainability may be represented as a number of objectives to be maximised or minimised. However, the full decision space of these objectives is usually very large and simplifications are necessary to safeguard computational feasibility. Different optimisation approaches have been proposed in the literature, usually based on mathematical programming techniques. Here, we present a search approach based on a multiobjective evaluation technique within an evolutionary algorithm (EA), linked to the APSIM cropping systems model.A simple case study addressing crop choice and sowing rules in North-East Australian cropping systems is used to illustrate the methodology. Sustainability of these systems is evaluated in terms of economic performance and resource use. Due to the limited size of this sample problem, the quality of the EA optimisation can be assessed by comparison to the full problem domain. Results demonstrate that the EA procedure, parameterised with generic parameters from the literature, converges to a useable solution set within a reasonable amount of time. Frontier "peels" or Pareto-optimal solutions as described by the multiobjective evaluation procedure provide useful information for discussion on trade-offs between conflicting objectives.},

Widely used simulation packages were re-implemented using advanced techniques, and nine new modelling solutions were built hybridizing across the original ones. Multi-metric indices were developed for modelling solution evaluation. The hybrid solution implementing the Parton's approach (surface temperature) and the SWAT (temperature along the soil profile) led to the best compromise between agreement and robustness under the explored conditions. Differently, choices of soil water redistribution models caused a modest variability with respect to the simulation of soil temperature. The methodology presented allows providing clear indications about model choice and should be considered useful practice in model development. The model libraries used to run the analysis are freely available for download, and they allow for further extension of the composition exercise.},

	abstract = {Some objective criteria for defining conditions of exceptional drought were evaluated using the GrassGro decision support tool. In two analyses, pasture and animal production were simulated from historical daily weather records for the last 95 years at sites in central New South Wales. The first analysis successfully discriminated between two sites 40 km apart, only one of which had received an effective fall of rain during a long dry spell. In the second analysis, production was simulated at one of these sites to identify the exceptional droughts over the 95-year period from the percentage ranking of moving averages of monthly rainfall, available green herbage and the supplementary feed required for sheep survival. Greater summer rainfall in the second half of the period meant that most of the exceptional droughts were in the first half. We suggest that a monitoring system based on shire-by-shire simulations of appropriate grazing systems, using 18-month moving averages of the weight of supplementary feed required for the survival of the animals, may be a practicable way of establishing exceptional drought circumstances.},

	abstract = {CSIRO Plant Industry has developed the GRAZPLAN family of decision support tools (DS tools) for consultants and farmers to improve the profitability and environmental sustainability of grazing enterprises. These tools are based on pasture and animal production models that have general application for simulating the biophysical processes of grazing systems in temperate southern Australia. The DS tools are designed to be easy to use and, apart from daily weather information, require minimal input of data. Where relevant, the models run continuously over a range of specified years, without further intervention by the user. The output generated can be linked to cost and price indices to enable estimation of production risk in financial as well as in biological terms.Adoption of GrazFeed, a tool to guide livestock nutrition, is widespread in the southern states where it is a keystone for the very successful PROGRAZE extension program sponsored by NSW Agriculture and Meat and Livestock Australia. GrazFeed's success is linked to the release of national feeding standards for ruminants, to the tactical nature of decisions about livestock nutrition and to a formal commitment by CSIRO, the developers, with NSW Agriculture, a major user. Adoption of another tool, GrassGro, which is used to analyse grazing enterprises for profit and sustainability, is slower. In this case the decision support is concerned with strategic planning where outcomes are probability-based and where the pasture model in GrassGro is not based on an agreed national standard. Confidence in the use of GrassGro increases where users are already familiar with GrazFeed, which contains an identical animal model. A key component of the commercial release of GrassGro is the provision of an intensive training course.Future adoption of the DS tools will be enhanced by their innovative use in teaching programs such as that at the University of New England where they are used in all undergraduate years of the rural science course.},

This framework comprises a) tools for ingesting and converting large amounts of data to a versatile datatype based on a common geospatial grid; b) tools for translating this datatype into custom formats for site-based models; c) a scalable parallel framework for performing large ensemble simulations, using any one of a number of different impacts models, on clusters, supercomputers, distributed grids, or clouds; d) tools and data standards for reformatting outputs to common datatypes for analysis and visualization; and e) methodologies for aggregating these datatypes to arbitrary spatial scales such as administrative and environmental demarcations. By automating many time-consuming and error-prone aspects of large-scale climate impacts studies, pSIMS accelerates computational research, encourages model intercomparison, and enhances reproducibility of simulation results. We present the pSIMS design and use example assessments to demonstrate its multi-model, multi-scale, and multi-sector versatility.},

This paper reports on the development and testing of a model of lupin development and growth, designed for use in the cropping systems simulator, APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator). Parameters describing leaf area expansion, phenology, radiation interception, biomass accumulation and partitioning, water use, and nitrogen accumulation were obtained from the literature or derived from field experiments. The model was developed and tested using data from experiments including different locations, cultivars, sowing dates, soil types, and water supplies. Flowering dates ranged from 71 to 109 days after sowing and were predicted by the model with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 4?5 days. Observed grain yields ranged from 0.5 to 2.7 t/ha and were simulated by the model with a RMSD of 0.5 t/ha. Simulation of a waterlogging effect on photosynthesis improved the model performance for leaf area index (LAI), biomass, and yield. The effect of variable rainfall in Western Australia and sowing date on yield was analysed using the model and historical weather data. Yield reductions were found with delay in sowing, particularly in water-limited environments. The model can be used for assessing some agronomic and management options and quantifying potential yields for specific locations, soil types, and sowing dates in Western Australia.},

A relatively detailed description of the OO framework and of the OO implementation of TOMGRO is given. The objective is to provide neophyte readers with a practical example of an OO implementation of a non-trivial model and to interest readers who are more familiar with software engineering issues in general through the presentation and discussion of the various software constructs.},

	abstract = {In Australia, and particularly in the northern part of the grain belt, wheat is grown in an extremely variable climate. The wheat crop manager in this region is faced with complex decisions on choice of planting time, varietal development pattern, and fertiliser strategy. A skilful seasonal forecast would provide an opportunity for the manager to tailor crop management decisions more appropriately to the season. Recent developments in climate research have led to the development of a number of seasonal climate forecasting systems. The objectives of this study were to determine the value of the capability in seasonal forecasting to wheat crop management, to compare the value of the existing forecast methodologies, and to consider the potential value of improved forecast quality. We examined decisions on nitrogen (N) fertiliser and cultivar maturity using simulation analyses of specific production scenarios at a representative location (Goondiwindi) using long-term daily weather data (1894-1989). The average profit and risk of making a loss were calculated for the possible range of fixed (i.e. the same every year) and tactical (i.e. varying depending on seasonal forecast) strategies. Significant increase in profit (up to 20\%) and/or reduction in risk (up to 35\%) were associated with tactical adjustment of crop management of N fertiliser or cultivar maturity. The forecasting system giving greatest value was the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) phase system of Stone and Auliciems (1992), which classifies seasons into 5 phases depending on the value and rate of change in the SOI. The significant skill in this system for forecasting both seasonal rainfall and frost timing generated the value found in tactical management of N fertiliser and cultivar maturity. Possible impediments to adoption of tactical management, associated with uncertainties in forecasting individual years, are discussed. The scope for improving forecast quality and the means to achieve it are considered by comparing the value of tactical management based on SO1 phases with the outcome given perfect prior knowledge of the season. While the analyses presented considered only one decision at a time, used specific scenarios, and made a number of simplifying assumptions, they have demonstrated that the current skill in seasonal forecasting is sufficient to justify use in tactical management of crops. More comprehensive studies to examine sensitivities to location, antecedent conditions, and price structure, and to assumptions made in this analysis, are now warranted. We have examined decisions related only to management of wheat. It would be appropriate to pursue similar analyses in relation to management decisions for other crops, cropping sequences, and the whole farm enterprise mix.},

	abstract = {Wheat cropping in the northern sector of the Australian wheat belt has been expanding into a region with a more marginal moisture regime and a more variable climate than in the established cropping regions. To provide a sound basis for land use assessment, the likely reliability of cropping in this region was examined. Reliability included the likelihood of planting a wheat crop in any year and the likely yield of planted crops. Simulation studies, using an appropriate model of the cropping system and long-term rainfall records (92-year period), were used to derive yield probability distributions for sites throughout the region. The main features of the cropping system model developed are outlined. The yield probability distributions and associated economic analyses indicated that expansion of wheat cropping in this region was likely. Trends in simulated yield sequences were compared with analyses of factors associated with recent climatic change. Similarities of patterns suggested an association of rainfall and yield trends with climate forcing factors. Implications of this association are discussed. A better understanding of the action of the climate forcing factors is required before possible climatic change can be included in determining reliability of cropping.},

Similarly, replacing a part of a model with a functionally equivalent part from another model is typically difficult. The objective of this study was to develop a method to enable the assembly of simulation models from previously and independently developed component models. Recent advances in software engineering have enabled the development of software applications from smaller parts (called components) on the basis of an abstract decomposition of the relevant domain (called a framework). Based on a requirements analysis of existing simulation models we developed the ModCom simulation framework. ModCom provides a set of interface specifications that describe components in a simulation. ModCom also provides implementations of the core simulation services. The framework interfaces use well-defined binary standards and allows developers to implement the interfaces using a broad range of computer languages. Using this framework, simulation models can be assembled by connecting component models in much the same way that Lego blocks are put together to assemble a house. ModCom thus allows modelers to create models and modeling tools that are easily exchanged (in binary form or source code) with colleagues across the hall or across the globe.},

Soil sub-order was shown to influence all components of PAWC (means of 224 and 182 mm in Black and Grey Vertosols, respectively) with drained upper limit (DUL), bulk density (BD), and crop lower limits (CLL) showing clear separation between soil sub-orders and a trend with soil depth. In addition to soil sub-order and soil depth effects, CLL showed crop effects such that expected PAWC of various crops when adjusted for soil sub-orders were: cotton 240 mm; wheat 233 mm; sorghum 225 mm; fababean 209 mm; chickpea 197 mm; barley 191 mm; and mungbean 130 mm. A total of 549 measured CLL values were used to develop a predictive model for estimating CLL from the soil sub-order, depth, DUL, and crop by predicting a CLL as a function of DUL and a depth-dependent variable for each crop-soil sub-order. The model CLL = DUL * (a + b * DUL) explained 85\% of observed variation in the measured data with no significant bias between observed and predicted data. While properly measured data would be more reliable than estimated data, where specific site accuracy is less critical, this model may be used to estimate PAWC with an acceptable degree of accuracy.},

	abstract = {Soils with high levels of chloride and/or sodium in their subsurface layers are often referred to as having subsoil constraints (SSCs). There is growing evidence that SSCs affect wheat yields by increasing the lower limit of a crop's available soil water (CLL) and thus reducing the soil's plant-available water capacity (PAWC). This proposal was tested by simulation of 33 farmers' paddocks in south-western Queensland and north-western New South Wales. The simulated results accounted for 79\% of observed variation in grain yield, with a root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of 0.50 t/ha. This result was as close as any achieved from sites without SSCs, thus providing strong support for the proposed mechanism that SSCs affect wheat yields by increasing the CLL and thus reducing the soil's PAWC. In order to reduce the need to measure CLL of every paddock or management zone, two additional approaches to simulating the effects of SSCs were tested. In the first approach the CLL of soils was predicted from the 0.3-0.5m soil layer, which was taken as the reference CLL of a soil regardless of its level of SSCs, while the CLL values of soil layers below 0.5m depth were calculated as a function of these soils' 0.3-0.5m CLL values as well as of soil depth plus one of the SSC indices EC, Cl, ESP, or Na. The best estimates of subsoil CLL values were obtained when the effects of SSCs were described by an ESP-dependent function. In the second approach, depth-dependent CLL values were also derived from the CLL values of the 0.3-0.5msoil layer. However, instead of using SSC indices to further modify CLL, the default values of the water-extraction coefficient (kl) of each depth layer were modified as a function of the SSC indices. The strength of this approach was evaluated on the basis of correlation of observed and simulated grain yields. In this approach the best estimates were obtained when the default kl values were multiplied by a Cl-determined function. The kl approach was also evaluated with respect to simulated soil moisture at anthesis and at grain maturity. Results using this approach were highly correlated with soil moisture results obtained from simulations based on the measured CLL values. This research provides strong evidence that the effects of SSCs on wheat yields are accounted for by the effects of these constraints on wheat CLL values. The study also produced two satisfactory methods for simulating the effects of SSCs on CLL and on grain yield. While Cl and ESP proved to be effective indices of SSCs, EC was not effective due to the confounding effect of the presence of gypsum in some of these soils. This study provides the tools necessary for investigating the effects of SSCs on wheat crop yields and natural resource management (NRM) issues such as runoff, recharge, and nutrient loss through simulation studies. It also facilitates investigation of suggested agronomic adaptations to SSCs.},

	abstract = {In Australia, a land subject to high annual variation in grain yields, farmers find it challenging to adjust crop production inputs to yield prospects. Scientists have responded to this problem by developing Decision Support Systems, yet the scientists' enthusiasm for developing these tools has not been reciprocated by farm managers or their advisers, who mostly continue to avoid their use. Preceding papers in this series described the FARMSCAPE intervention: a new paradigm for decision support that had significant effects on farmers and their advisers. These effects were achieved in large measure because of the intensive effort which scientists invested in engaging with their clients. However, such intensive effort is time consuming and economically unsustainable and there remained a need for a more cost-effective tool. In this paper, we report on the evolution, structure, and performance of Yield Prophet\&\#xae;: an internet service designed to move on from the FARMSCAPE model to a less intensive, yet high quality, service to reduce farmer uncertainty about yield prospects and the potential effects of alternative management practices on crop production and income. Compared with conventional Decision Support Systems, Yield Prophet offers flexibility in problem definition and allows farmers to more realistically specify the problems in their fields. Yield Prophet also uniquely provides a means for virtual monitoring of the progress of a crop throughout the season. This is particularly important for in-season decision support and for frequent reviewing, in real time, of the consequences of past decisions and past events on likely future outcomes. The Yield Prophet approach to decision support is consistent with two important, but often ignored, lessons from decision science: that managers make their decisions by satisficing rather than optimising and that managers' fluid approach to decision making requires ongoing monitoring of the consequences of past decisions.},

	abstract = {The environmental modelling community has developed many models with varying levels of complexity and functionality. Many of these have overlapping problem domains, have very similar `science' and yet are not compatible with each other. The modelling community recognises the benefits to model exchange and reuse, but often it is perceived to be easier to (re)create a new model than to take an existing one and adapt it to new needs.Many of these third party models have been incorporated into the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM), a farming systems modelling framework. Some of the issues encountered during this process were system boundary issues (the functional boundary between models and sub-models), mixed programming languages, differences in data semantics, intellectual property and ownership.This paper looks at these difficulties and how they were overcome. It explores some software development techniques that facilitated the process and discusses some guidelines that can not only make this process simpler but also move models towards framework independence.},

	doi = {10.1071/CP11268},
	abstract = {In southern Australia, summer fallow rain (SFR) has not traditionally been valued for winter crop production. Modern, higher yielding farming practices combined with a decade of below-average growing-season rainfall and a predicted increase in the proportion of summer rain under future climate patterns have stimulated a re-evaluation of this notion.We used a widely validated crop simulation model (APSIM-Wheat) to quantify the potential value of SFR to wheat yield under contemporary farming practices using long-term climatic data at 37 locations throughout southern Australia.The potential value of SFR was high, contributing on average 1.0 t/ha or 33\% of water-limited attainable yield. Yield increases were due to both increased water use and increased water-use efficiency through higher harvest index. The contribution to yield varied significantly according to the rainfall distribution and soil type across sites. In central-west New South Wales, the equi-seasonal rainfall pattern, high soil water-holding capacity and variable spring rainfall resulted in SFR contributing up to 2.0 t/ha or 72\% of mean simulated wheat yield. In contrast, in the north-western grain belt of Western Australia, SFR contributed as little as 0.1 t/ha or 3\% of mean simulated yield due to strong Mediterranean rainfall pattern, low soil water-holding capacity and reliable growing-season rainfall. At all locations there was significant year-to-year variation in the simulated yield contribution of SFR. At a given site, soils with higher water-holding capacity in the surface tended to reduce summer fallow efficiency (proportion of summer rainfall stored at sowing) due to the failure of most summer rain to penetrate below the evaporation zone. Despite seasonal variability in yield contribution, interventions to preserve summer rainfall, such as strict summer weed control generated high return on investment (range 6-1328\%; mean 733\%). Risk of financial loss due to strict summer weed control varied across sites, with failure to achieve a return on investment occurring in 1-70\% of years depending on location.The proportion of annual rain falling during the summer fallow period in some locations has increased in the last 10 years and this forecast result of climate change is likely to increase the value of SFR to wheat production in the future.},

Agricultural systems models are regularly employed in studying sustainable crop management but no detailed model is currently available for oil palm systems. We developed a production systems model for oil palm within the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) framework and tested it using data across a range of environments within Papua New Guinea (PNG). The model captured key growth responses to climate and management. This demonstrates that modern modelling frameworks do allow for rapid model development for new agricultural systems. However, whilst application of the model is promising, the availability of key data is likely to restrict its use. Local soil and weather data are not available in adequate detail for many of the major oil palm production areas, although some methods exist to address this.},

	abstract = {The long-term benefits of retaining or planting trees on farms to rehabilitate land and protect the soil from erosion or salinity problems has to be traded off against the impact of tree competition on commercial crops, especially in the medium to low rainfall regions of Australia. The incentive to plant trees would increase if tree competition could be offset by economic returns gained from farm forestry products and by the beneficial impacts of tree windbreaks on crop yields and resource sustainability. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) has a well-established capability to simulate cropping systems and this paper reports on progress in applying APSIM to agroforestry systems in order to quantify the potential benefits and risks of planting trees as windbreaks to cropping land in Australia. A simple case study indicating one possible model configuration is used to demonstrate this emergent capability for simulating tree and crop productivity and their interactions. The simulated agroforestry system consisted of the growth of a belt of trees (Eucalyptus argophloia) positioned as a windbreak on the edge of a field where a crop of winter chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is grown over a 30-year period. The example simulations quantify the yield and economic returns of annual chickpea crops in addition to the discounted economic return from timber production after 30 years of tree growth. This example demonstrates how APSIM can be used to quantify the economic tradeoffs in planting trees as windbreaks on a commercial farm in a low rainfall region of Australia.},

	abstract = {Models are increasingly being relied upon to inform and support natural resource management. They are incorporating an ever broader range of disciplines and now often confront people without strong quantitative or model-building backgrounds. These trends imply a need for wider awareness of what constitutes good model-development practice, including reporting of models to users and sceptical review of models by users. To this end the paper outlines ten basic steps of good, disciplined model practice. The aim is to develop purposeful, credible models from data and prior knowledge, in consort with end-users, with every stage open to critical review and revision. Best practice entails identifying clearly the clients and objectives of the modelling exercise; documenting the nature (quantity, quality, limitations) of the data used to construct and test the model; providing a strong rationale for the choice of model family and features (encompassing review of alternative approaches); justifying the techniques used to calibrate the model; serious analysis, testing and discussion of model performance; and making a resultant statement of model assumptions, utility, accuracy, limitations, and scope for improvement. In natural resource management applications, these steps will be a learning process, even a partnership, between model developers, clients and other interested parties.},

	abstract = {The decision support system for agrotechnology transfer (DSSAT) has been in use for the last 15 years by researchers worldwide. This package incorporates models of 16 different crops with software that facilitates the evaluation and application of the crop models for different purposes. Over the last few years, it has become increasingly difficult to maintain the DSSAT crop models, partly due to fact that there were different sets of computer code for different crops with little attention to software design at the level of crop models themselves. Thus, the DSSAT crop models have been re-designed and programmed to facilitate more efficient incorporation of new scientific advances, applications, documentation and maintenance. The basis for the new DSSAT cropping system model (CSM) design is a modular structure in which components separate along scientific discipline lines and are structured to allow easy replacement or addition of modules. It has one Soil module, a Crop Template module which can simulate different crops by defining species input files, an interface to add individual crop models if they have the same design and interface, a Weather module, and a module for dealing with competition for light and water among the soil, plants, and atmosphere. It is also designed for incorporation into various application packages, ranging from those that help researchers adapt and test the CSM to those that operate the DSSAT-CSM to simulate production over time and space for different purposes. In this paper, we describe this new DSSAT-CSM design as well as approaches used to model the primary scientific components (soil, crop, weather, and management). In addition, the paper describes data requirements and methods used for model evaluation. We provide an overview of the hundreds of published studies in which the DSSAT crop models have been used for various applications. The benefits of the new, re-designed DSSAT-CSM will provide considerable opportunities to its developers and others in the scientific community for greater cooperation in interdisciplinary research and in the application of knowledge to solve problems at field, farm, and higher levels.},

	abstract = {One of the main goals of the International Consortium for Agricultural Systems Applications (ICASA) is to advance the development and application of compatible and complementary models, data and other systems analysis tools. To help reach that goal, it will adopt and recommend modular approaches that facilitate more systematic model development, documentation, maintenance, and sharing. In this paper, we present criteria and guidelines for modules that will enable them to be plugged into existing models to replace an existing component or to add a new one with minimal changes. This will make it possible to accept contributions from a wide group of modellers with specialities in different disciplines. Two approaches to modular model development have emerged from different research groups in ICASA. One approach was developed by extending the programming methods used in the Fortran Simulation Environment developed in The Netherlands. This method is being used in revisions of some of the Decision Support Systems for Agrotechnology Transfer crop models. A simple example of this approach is given in which a plant growth module is linked with a soil water balance module to create a crop model that simulates growth and yield for a uniform area. The second approach has been evolving within the Agricultural Production Systems Research Unit group in Australia. This approach, implemented in software called Agricultural Production Systems Simulator, consists of plug-in/pull-out modules and an infrastructure for inter-module communication. The two approaches have important similarities, but also differ in implementation details. In both cases, avoiding reliance on any particular programming language has been an important design criterion. By comparing features of both approaches, we have started to develop a set of recommendations for module design that will lead to a `toolkit' of modules that can be shared throughout the ICASA network.},

The paper outlines APSIM's structure and provides details of the concepts behind the different plant, soil and management modules. These modules include a diverse range of crops, pastures and trees, soil processes including water balance, N and P transformations, soil pH, erosion and a full range of management controls. Reports of APSIM testing in a diverse range of systems and environments are summarised. An example of model performance in a long-term cropping systems trial is provided. APSIM has been used in a broad range of applications, including support for on-farm decision making, farming systems design for production or resource management objectives, assessment of the value of seasonal climate forecasting, analysis of supply chain issues in agribusiness activities, development of waste management guidelines, risk assessment for government policy making and as a guide to research and education activity.

	abstract = {The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) modelling framework was used to explore components of the water balance for a range of farming systems in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) of Australia. Water leaking below the root zone of annual crops and pastures in this region is leading to development of dryland salinity and delivery of salt to waterways. Simulation modelling was used to identify the relative magnitude of transpiration, soil evaporation, runoff and drainage and to explore temporal variability in these terms for selected locations over the 1957-1998 climate record. Two transects were used to explore the impact of climate on water balance, with all other factors held constant, including the soil. An east-west transect at approximately latitude 33°S demonstrates the primary effect of annual average rainfall ranging from 300 to 850 mm. A north-south transect along approximately the 600 mm rainfall isohyet demonstrates a secondary effect of rainfall distribution, with the fraction of annual rainfall received in winter months rising from 40\% in the north to 70\% in the south. Water excess (i.e. runoff plus drainage) is strongly episodic, with 60\% simulated to occur in 25\% of years. Longer term cycles are also evident in the time series simulations, with strong below average periods from 1959-1968 and 1979-1988 interspersed with extended periods of above average water excess from 1969-1978 and 1989-1993. Water excess was highest for the annual wheat farming system and lowest for perennial lucerne pasture. Other systems that mix summer and winter annuals (opportunity cropping) or include wheat and lucerne pasture in different temporal combinations (phase farming and companion cropping) were intermediate in their simulated water excess. These differences in water balance of the farming systems simulated were associated with differences in grain and forage yields that will affect their economic viability. The predictions of annual water excess derived from the dynamic, daily time-step modelling using APSIM for a wheat based farming system were of similar magnitude as those predicted by the static model for shallow rooted pasture catchments, whilst continuous lucerne was similar to predictions for deep rooted forest catchments. To capture the effect of rainfall distribution between winter and summer an additional term was added to the Zhang model. This modified function captured 88\% of the variation in the APSIM predictions of annual average water excess from annual wheat systems for 78 locations in the MDB.},

	abstract = {Generally accepted standards for testing and validating ecosystem models would benefit both modellers and model users. Universally applicable test procedures are difficult to prescribe, given the diversity of modelling approaches and the many uses for models. However, the generally accepted scientific principles of documentation and disclosure provide a useful framework for devising general standards for model evaluation. Adequately documenting model tests requires explicit performance criteria, and explicit benchmarks against which model performance is compared. A model's validity, reliability, and accuracy can be most meaningfully judged by explicit comparison against the available alternatives. In contrast, current practice is often characterized by vague, subjective claims that model predictions show `acceptable' agreement with data; such claims provide little basis for choosing among alternative models. Strict model tests (those that invalid models are unlikely to pass) are the only ones capable of convincing rational skeptics that a model is probably valid. However, `false positive' rates as low as 10\% can substantially erode the power of validation tests, making them insufficiently strict to convince rational skeptics. Validation tests are often undermined by excessive parameter calibration and overuse of ad hoc model features. Tests are often also divorced from the conditions under which a model will be used, particularly when it is designed to forecast beyond the range of historical experience. In such situations, data from laboratory and field manipulation experiments can provide particularly effective tests, because one can create experimental conditions quite different from historical data, and because experimental data can provide a more precisely defined `target' for the model to hit. We present a simple demonstration showing that the two most common methods for comparing model predictions to environmental time series (plotting model time series against data time series, and plotting predicted versus observed values) have little diagnostic power. We propose that it may be more useful to statistically extract the relationships of primary interest from the time series, and test the model directly against them.},

	abstract = {The pasture growth module AgPasture was integrated into the APSIM (Agricultural Production System Simulator) simulation model, allowing pasture-based systems to be modelled in combination with other land uses at farm scale or within land use change studies. The model's predictions of pasture growth were evaluated against 32 pasture growth datasets from a diverse range of soil types and climatic zones across New Zealand. The pasture herbage accumulation simulated by the model closely matched actual measurements over varying intervals. Both predicted and measured pasture growth rate demonstrated the same seasonal pattern, including mean growth rate and inter-annual variation across measurement years. Predicted and measured annual average net herbage accumulation (NHA) on a dryland pasture was similar over 37 observation years (mean, 6.83 and 7.27 t DM/ha respectively; coefficient of variation, 29\% and 27\% respectively) and highly correlated (R(2) = 0.838, P {\textless} 0.0001; relative root mean squared deviation (RMSD) = 16\%). The model's prediction of annual average NHA of all simulated pastures, spanninga wide range of pasture environments, also matched the measurement data well (R(2) = 0.777, P {\textless} 0.0001; relative RMSD = 21\%). However, discrepancies between simulated and observed values occurred in some seasons and at some sites. Analysis of these discrepancies identified areas where the model could be improved by incorporating more accurate descriptions of the effects of plant development and grazing, soil temperature and the interactive effects of high temperature and soil moisture dynamics.},

	abstract = {Inadequate ground cover because of over-grazing of pastures, fallowing and stubble burning or excessive cultivation exposes land to degradation, yet maintaining cover can constrain productivity. We used long-term simulation analysis to investigate the impact of modifying stock and crop management practices on the trade-off between farm productivity (grain, meat and wool) and ground cover levels. Management of mixed farms at five locations (426–657 mm mean annual rainfall) in the Murrumbidgee catchment of New South Wales was represented for simulated farms that included permanent pastures, crop–pasture rotations, and a meat/wool sheep enterprise. Locations varied in their stocking rate, soil characteristics and proportion of land area allocated to various crops and pastures. At each location we investigated the impact on ground cover and farm productivity of (1) retention of wheat stubble, (2) altering stocking rate (up to ±25\%) and (3) moving stock elsewhere on the farm when the mean value of ground cover fell below a given threshold (50, 60, 70, 80 or 90\%) for either, all pasture on the farm or an individual paddock. The analysis showed that seasonal conditions were the dominant effect on the mean farm cover (mean range 64–98\%); cover fell as low as 43–57\% in severe droughts, depending on location. Retention of wheat stubble increased long-term mean cover by 1–4\%, with little impact on grain yield. Altering stocking rate had the largest impact on cover at all locations (up to 4\%), although there was a trade-off with productivity. Maintaining a constant stocking rate, although moving stock within the farm, had a small, positive effect on the whole-farm cover, although it reduced gross margin because of the cost of supplementary feeding. Confining stock to a 3 ha feeding lot was the most effective strategy for maintaining ground cover and minimising financial loss. Our analysis did not account for the benefits of maintaining high levels of ground cover on the long-term productive capacity of the farm through on-farm or off-farm environmental benefits. We conclude that ground cover is dominated by climatic effects, and that within the range of stock management practices examined in the present study, practices that increase minimum cover levels also reduce farm productivity. Reducing total stocking rate, or removing stock from the farm during periods of low cover, will have the greatest impact on maintaining cover, although it will reduce whole-farm profit.},

	abstract = {The North China Plain (NCP) is the most important agricultural production area in China. Crop production in the NCP is sensitive to changes in both climate and management practices. While previous studies showed a negative impact of climatic change on crop yield since 1980s, the confounding effects of climatic and agronomic factors have not been separately investigated. This paper used 25 years of crop data from three locations (Nanyang, Zhengzhou and Luancheng) across the NCP, together with daily weather data and crop modeling, to analyse the contribution of changes in climatic and agronomic factors to changes in grain yields of wheat and maize. The results showed that the changes in climate were not uniform across the NCP and during different crop growth stages. Warming mainly occurred during the vegetative (preflowering) growth stage of wheat and maize, while there was a cooling trend or no significant change in temperatures during the postflowering stage of wheat (spring) or maize (autumn). If varietal effects were excluded, warming during vegetative stages would lead to a reduction in the length of the growing period for both crops, generally leading to a negative impact on crop production. However, autonomous adoption of new crop varieties in the NCP was able to compensate the negative impact of climatic change. For both wheat and maize, the varietal changes helped stabilize the length of preflowering period against the shortening effect of warming and, together with the slightly reduced temperature in the postflowering period, extend the length of the grain-filling period. The combined effect led to increased wheat yield at Zhengzhou and Luancheng; increased maize yield at Nanyang and Luancheng; stabilized wheat yield at Nanyang, and a slight reduction in maize yield at Zhengzhou, compared with the yield change caused entirely by climatic change.},

	abstract = {Northeast China (NEC) is not only one of the major agricultural production areas in China, but it is also the most susceptible to climate variability. This led us to investigate the impact of climate change on maize potential yield and yield gaps in this region, where maize accounts for about 30\% of the nation's production. The APSIM-Maize model was calibrated and validated for maize phenology and yields. The validated model was then used to estimate potential yields, rain-fed potential yields, and yield gaps for assessing the climate impacts on maize productivity in NEC. During maize growing seasons from 1981 to 2010, the analysis indicates a warming trend all across NEC, whereas the trends in solar radiation and total precipitation tended to decrease. When the same hybrid was specified in APSIM for all years, a simulated increase of maximum temperature resulted in a negative impact on both potential yield and rain-fed potential yield. A simulated increase in minimum temperature produced no significant changes in potential or rain-fed potential yield. However, the increase of minimum temperature was shown to result in a positive impact on the on-farm yield, consistent with our finding that farmers adopted longer season hybrids for which the increase in minimum temperature provided better conditions for germination, emergence, and grain filling during night time. The gap between potential and rain-fed potential yields was shown to be larger at locations with lower seasonal precipitation ({\textless}500 similar to mm). Our results indicate that regions with the largest yield gaps between rain-fed potential and on-farm yields were located in the southeast of NEC. Within NEC, on-farm maize yields were, on average, only 51\% of the potential yields, indicating a large exploitable yield gap, which provides an opportunity to significantly increase production by effective irrigation, fertilization, herbicide, and planting density in NEC.},

	abstract = {The environment in which crops will be grown in the future will change. CO2 concentrations [CO2] and temperatures (7) will probably increase and a decline of winter rainfall is predicted for south-west Australia. To be able to adapt crop systems to a changing climate it is important to know how different aspects of climate change affect agricultural production and how they interact. In a full factorial design we studied how higher T (2, 4 and 6 degrees C) elevated [CO2] (525 and 700 ppm) and five different rainfall scenarios affected wheat yield and grain protein. Effects of climate change were simulated with the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM-Nwheat) using transformed historic weather data. Fifty years of yield and grain protein concentrations were simulated for three soil types at different locations on a north-south transect within the wheatbelt of south-west Australia. Simulation results showed that there were complex interactions between different aspects of climate change on crop systems. Effects of higher temperatures, elevated [CO2] and changed rainfall were in general not linear and differed significantly between soil types and location. Higher [CO2] increased yield especially at drier sites while higher temperatures had a positive effect in the cooler and wetter southern part of the region. The main difference between soil types was that heavier clay soils are most vulnerable to reduced rainfall while sandy soils were more vulnerable to higher temperatures. Elevated [CO2] reduced grain protein concentration and lower rainfall increased protein levels at all sites. Higher temperatures could both increase and decrease protein concentrations. In the southern, higher rainfall part of south-western Australia, yield and gross margin will increase for all likely future climate scenarios. In the drier part of the region, negative effects of 15\% reduced rainfall can be compensated for by a 2 degrees C increase in temperature and 50\% higher [CO2] concentrations. However due to the non-linearity of climate change effects a 30\% reduction in rainfall cannot be compensated for by higher temperatures and [CO2] Crown Copyright (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Developing crop cultivars with novel traits could help agriculture adapt to climate change. As introducing new traits into crops is expensive and time consuming, it is helpful to develop methods which can test whether a potential new plant trait increases or maintains production in future climates. We used a crop-soil simulation model (APSIM-Nwheat) to test whether changes in physiological traits, related to early vigor and flowering time, would result in increased yield when compared to traditional cultivars of wheat grown at higher temperatures, elevated atmospheric CO(2) and lower rainfall in a Mediterranean climate. Early vigor was simulated by changing four different plant traits. The impact of each trait on grain yield varied with climate scenario and soil type. Higher specific leaf area had minimal effect on yield for the historical climate, but it could increase production in future warmer climates. Increased rooting depth generally had a positive impact on yield, while lower radiation use efficiency and earlier flowering tended to reduce yield. The interaction between these traits was generally positive, and our results indicate that early vigor may improve yield for a range of future climate scenarios. However, in the low rainfall regions, early vigor is unlikely to compensate for rainfall reductions of {\textgreater}= 30\%. Yield gains for early vigor are likely to be larger on sandy loam than on heavier clay soil. The simulation of cultivars differing in flowering time showed that in drier climates earlier flowering cultivars increase potential yield while in warming climates later cultivars; increase yield. In conclusion, our analyses suggest that there is great potential for adapting wheat systems to climate change by introducing cultivars with new traits. Our results also show how simulation analyses can assist plant breeders in determining which traits could be important for crop production in future climates. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The wheatbelt of Western Australia shows a distinct Mediterranean climate with most of the rainfall occurring in the winter months. The main factor limiting plant production in this region is rainfall. Due to clearing of native vegetation, dryland salinity is a major problem in south-west Australia. Since the mid 1970s the region has experienced a significant decrease in winter rainfall. Across nine sites, growing season rainfall (May to October) decreased by an average of 11\% and the sum of rainfall in June and July (June + July) decreased by 20\%. We used the ASPIM-Nwheat model in combination with historic climate data to study the impact of recent climate change on the hydrology and production of wheat based farming systems by comparing results for before and after 1975. Despite the large decline in rainfall, simulated yields based on the actual weather data did not fall. At the same time, simulated drainage decreased by up to 95\% which will significantly reduce the spread of dryland salinity. These results were due to the rainfall changes mainly occurring in June and July, a period when rainfall often exceeds crop demand and large amounts of water are usually lost by deep drainage. The findings will have significant implications for estimates of future climate change impacts in this region with changes in rainfall causing non-proportional impacts on production and hydrological aspects, such as deep drainage and waterlogging, where proportionality is often presumed.},

	abstract = {Evaluation of adaptive management options is very crucial for successfully dealing with negative climate change impacts. Research objectives of this study were (1) to determine the proper N application rate for current practice, (2) to select a range of synthetic wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars to expand the existing wheat cultivar pool for adaptation purpose, (3) to quantify the potential impacts of climate change on wheat grain yield and (4) to evaluate the effectiveness of three common management options such as early sowing, changing N application rate and use of different wheat cultivars derived in (2) and given in the APSIM-Wheat model package in dealing with the projected negative impacts for Keith, South Australia. The APSIM-Wheat model was used to achieve these objectives. It was found that 75 kg ha(-1) N application at sowing for current situation is appropriate for the study location. This provided a non-limiting N supply condition for climate change impact and adaptation evaluation. Negative impacts of climate change on wheat grain yield were projected under both high (-15\%) and low (-10\%) plant available water capacity conditions. Neither changes in N application level nor in wheat cultivar alone nor their synergistic effects could offset the negative climate change impact. It was found that early sowing is an effective adaptation strategy when initial soil water was reset at 25 mm at sowing but this may be hard to realise especially since a drier environment is projected.

Monte Carlo random sampling techniques were applied to component ranges of uncertainty defined by quantified upper and lower limits, assuming uniform probability over each range. Construction of resulting probability distributions of regional climate provided a framework for risk analysis. These probabilities were applied to the Agricultural Production System sIMulator (APSIM)-Wheat model to evaluate potential wheat production at Roseworthy for the year 2080 through the identification of critical yield thresholds. The conditional probability of not meeting the critical yield threshold increased from 27\% under baseline conditions to 45\% under the median probability for the year 2080, indicating less profitable wheat production in the study area.},

	abstract = {During the 14-month-long fallow that arises when moving from summer to winter crops, stubble breakdown can denude the soil surface and leave it vulnerable to erosion. Cover crops of millet have been proposed as a solution, but this then raises the question, how often is there sufficient water in the system to grow a cover crop without reducing the soil water reserves to the point of prejudicing the following wheat crop? An on-farm research approach was used to compare the traditional long fallow (TF) with a millet fallow (MF) in a total of 31 commercial paddocks over 3 years. Each treatment was simulated using the simulation-modelling framework (APSIM) to investigate the outcomes over a longer timeframe and to determine how often a millet fallow could be successfully included within the farming system. The on-farm trials showed that early-sown millet cover crops removed before December had no effect on wheat yield, but this was not true of millet cover crops that were allowed to grow through to maturity. Long-term simulations estimated that a spring cover crop of millet would adversely affect wheat yields in only 2\% of years if planted early and removed after 50\% cover had been achieved.},

	abstract = {The intention of this paper it to open up debate within the environmental modelling and software (EMS) community on how best to respond to the increasing desire to evaluate the success of EMS projects in terms of outcomes rather than outputs. Outcomes in these regards are changes beyond the walls of the research organisation (typically to values, attitudes and behaviour). The authors recognise that outcome evaluation is essential in ensuring the relevance and effectiveness of activities. To date, however, there is a limited appreciation within the EMS community of the nature of the challenge inherent in outcome evaluations. The paper presents an exploratory analysis of the challenges that outcome assessment raises for EMS. It does so using mutually reinforcing conceptual and practical perspectives. The paper presents a conceptual framework of three loosely coupled phases – research, development and operations. The nature of activities and their interactions within these phases is outlined and the forms of evaluation associated with each stage set out. The paper notes how existing forms of evaluation (e.g. peer review, validation and relevance) underpin the delivery of outcomes but do not of themselves evaluate outcomes. The paper proposes that outcomes need conceptually to be seen as an element of complex social processes mediated by government, regulation, markets and the media rather than as simply another form of output from research and development projects. As such outcomes of EMS are: less easily tangible than are outputs; more likely to occur at a significant time lag after any intervention; more difficult to assign causality for and to be subject to significant contestation. Thus EMS activity, however well conducted technically, may only have a minor influence on outcomes and EMS practitioners will have limited control over those outcomes that do occur. The paper uses a series of linked EMS projects to populate the conceptual framework showing the role of evaluations in research, development and operations phases. The paper then presents two forms (quantitative and qualitative) of outcome evaluation used as part of an operational phase evaluation of a project communicating the consequences of climate change to remote-rural land managers in Scotland. The authors conclude that while the challenges of EMS evaluation can be met, there needs to be care from the EMS community not to raise expectations of outcomes that cannot be met.},

	abstract = {The idea that simulation models of agricultural production can serve as tools for farmers remains a compelling idea even after 3 decades of mostly disappointing development efforts. This paper is the first in a series that reports on 17 years of systems research that used models differently from the Decision Support System idea that has dominated the field. The starting point of FARMSCAPE (Farmers', Advisers', Researchers', Monitoring, Simulation, Communication And Performance Evaluation) was finding whether farmers could value simulation when conditions for appreciation were improved by (a) specifying the simulator for individual paddocks in question and (b) delivering customised simulation to decision makers as a supporting service rather than software as a decision support product. The first aim of the program has been to learn how to effectively intervene in farm management practice using complex, abstract models of croplands, specified with local soil, climate, and management data. The second aim has been to learn how a resulting service that farmers value can be delivered cost effectively by a third party. This first paper deals with an aspect of the first aim, i.e. valued decision support intervention. In the terms used by Checkland (1981), the activities that served this systems practice aim were guided by \&\#x2018;what we thought we were doing' in intervening in farmers' practice, i.e. our systems thinking. This first paper concerns FARMSCAPE systems thinking and how it evolved over 17 years as we learned successively through discovery of a new concept or representation in the literature to overcome limitations of the then-current conceptual framework. Subsequent papers deal with customising scientific monitoring and simulation for farmers, communication as engagement in situations of practice, understanding decision support intervention as facilitation of personal knowledge construction, and piloting commercial delivery of a simulation-based service to farmers and their advisers.},

	abstract = {APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator) is a software system which allows (a) models of crop and pasture production, residue decomposition, soil water and nutrient flow, and erosion to be readily re-configured to simulate various production systems and (b) soil and crop management to be dynamically simulated using conditional rules. A key innovation is change from a core concept of a crop responding to resource supplies to that of a soil responding to weather, management and crops. While this achieves a sound logical structure for improved simulation of soil management and long-term change in the soil resource, it does so without loss of sensitivity in simulating crop yields. This concept is implemented using a program structure in which all modules (e.g. growth of specific crops, soil water, soil N, erosion) communicate with each other only by messages passed via a central `engine'. Using a standard interface design, this design enables easy removal, replacement, or exchange of modules without disruption to the operation of the system. Simulation of crop sequences and multiple crops are achieved by managing connection of crop growth modules to the engine.A shell of software tools has been developed within a WINDOWS environment which includes user-installed editor, linker, compiler, testbed generator, graphics, database and version control software. While the engine and modules are coded in FORTRAN, the Shell is in C++. The resulting product is one in which the functions are coded in the language most familiar to the developers of scientific modules but provides many of the features of object oriented programming. The Shell is written to be aware of UNIX operating systems and be capable of using the processor on UNIX workstations.},

	abstract = {Yield advantages of crops grown behind windbreaks have often been reported, but underlying principles responsible for such changes and their long-term consequences on crop productivity and hence farm income have rarely been quantified. Physiologically and physically sound simulation models could help to achieve this quantification. Hence, the APSIM systems model, which is based on physiological principles such as transpiration efficiency and radiation use efficiency (termed here APSIM$_{\textrm{TE}}$), and the Soil Canopy Atmosphere Model (SCAM), which is based on the Penman\&\#8211;Monteith equation but includes a full surface energy balance, were employed in developing an approach to quantify such windbreak effects. This resulted in a modified APSIM version (APSIM$_{\textrm{EO}}$), containing the original Penman equation and a calibration factor to account for crop- and site-specific differences, which were tested against field data and simulations from both the standard APSIM$_{\textrm{TE}}$ and SCAM models. {\textless}p{\textgreater} The APSIM$_{\textrm{EO}}$ approach was tested against field data for wheat and mungbean grown in artificial enclosures in south-east Queensland and in south-east Western Australia. For these sheltered conditions, daily transpiration demand estimates from APSIM$_{\textrm{EO}}$ compared closely to SCAM. As the APSIM$_{\textrm{EO }}$approach needed to be calibrated for individual crops and environments, average transpiration demand for open field conditions predicted by APSIM$_{\textrm{EO}}$ for a given site was adjusted to equal that obtained using APSIM$_{\textrm{TE}}$ by modifying a calibration parameter \&\#946;. For wheat, a \&\#946;-value of 1.0 resulted in best fits for Queensland, while for Western Australia a value of 0.85 was necessary. For mungbean a value of 0.92 resulted in the best fit (Qld). Biomass and yields simulated by APSIM$_{\textrm{TE}}$ and the calibration APSIM$_{\textrm{EO}}$ for wheat and mungbean grown in artificial enclosures were generally distributed around the 1:1 line, with \textit{R}$^{\textrm{2}}$ values ranging from 0.92 to 0.97. {\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater} Finally, APSIM$_{\textrm{EO}}$ was run at 2 sites using long-term climate data to assess the likely year-to-year variability of windbreak effects on crop yields. Assuming a 70\% reduction in wind speed as representing the maximum potential windbreak effect, the average yield improvement for the Queensland site was 13\% for wheat and 3\% for mungbean. For wheat at the WA site the average yield improvement from reduced wind speed was 5\%. In any year, however, effects varied from negative, neutral to positive, highlighting the highly variable nature of the expression of windbreak effects. {\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater} This study has shown how physical and biological modelling approaches can be combined to aid our understanding of systems processes. Both the environmental physics perspective and the biological perspective have shortcomings when issues that sit at the interface of both approaches need to be addressed. While the physical approach has clear advantages when investigating changes in physical parameters such as wind speed, vapour pressure deficit (VPD), temperature or the energy balance of the soil\&\#8211;plant\&\#8211;atmosphere continuum, it cannot deal with complex, biological systems adequately. Conversely, the crop physiological approach can handle such biological interactions in a scientific and robust way while certain atmospheric processes are not considered. The challenge was not to try and capture all these effects in 1 model, but rather to structure a modelling approach in a way that allowed for inclusion of such processes where necessary. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {A central concern of the Grain \&amp; Graze research, development and extension program has been improving the management of the feedbase on mixed farms through addressing ‘feed gaps’ – times of year during which the supply of forage is insufficient to meet livestock demand. In this review, we use the available data on pasture growth and quality, supplemented by modelling results, to describe the characteristic timing of feed gaps across the Australian cereal-livestock zone. Feedbase interventions studied during the Grain \&amp; Graze program have mainly addressed the supply side of the feed balance equation. We review these studies, paying particular attention to the time scale of the variability in the feed balance that each intervention is intended to address. We conclude that grazing of cereals (either dual-purpose or forage crops) is the most promising means of alleviating winter feed gaps in regions where they are important. Reducing feed gaps in summer by relying on unpredictable summer rainfall events will increase year-to-year variability in forage production and will therefore require more flexible livestock management systems to exploit it. The use of forage shrubs offers a practical tool for increasing the predictability of summer and autumn feed supply, but given their moderate capacity for providing additional metabolisable energy it remains important to carefully manage livestock over autumn and to manage the herbaceous inter-row pasture. Feed gaps mainly arise from an interaction between biology and economics. We find, however, that the options studied in the Grain \&amp; Graze program for addressing feed gaps require either greater complexity in pasture and grazing management or more opportunistic livestock trading; they therefore come at a cost to the manager’s limited decision-making time. Times with feed gaps are also times when particular natural resource management risks (especially erosion) need to be managed. Supply-side interventions to relieve feed gaps will generally use more soil water, which will often have positive effects on natural resource management outcomes.},

	abstract = {This paper specifies the pasture growth module of a model for simulating grazing systems for ruminants and the soil moisture budget that drives pasture growth. Both modules operate at a daily time step. The pasture growth module is quite general in structure but recognises four functional groups of pasture plants: annual and perennial species are distinguished, as are grasses and forbs. Shoot tissue is classified as live, senescing, standing dead, or litter, and also according to its dry matter digestibility, thus enabling integration with diet selection and feed intake models.The phenological development of pasture plants is modelled, with the transitions between each stage governed by environmental variables (day length, temperature and soil moisture). Prereproductive and postreproductive phenostages of vernalisation and `summer dormancy', respectively, are modelled in the appropriate cultivars. Functions predicting net primary production in response to light intercepted, mean daytime temperature, and available soil moisture, and also the process of maturation, are common to all functional groups. The model's treatment of the allocation of assimilate has a similarly general form. Seed and seedling dynamics are modelled for annual species only.GrassGro is a discrete computer package, developed for Microsoft Windows,TM that combines the pasture growth module with a module for predicting the intake of herbage of ruminants and their productivity. This decision support system enables users to analyse simplified grazing systems in terms of pasture and animal production, gross margins, and year-to-year variability for any specified pasture cultivar, or combination of cultivars, at any specified site. The package may also be used to simulate forward from current pasture and animal conditions, for assessing the probability distribution of production outcomes, given the historical variability of weather conditions over the specified forward period.},

Attempts to define higher-level organizing concepts in management policies, and to analyse them to identify optimal plans, have focussed on questions relating to grazing management owing to its inherent complexity. “Rule templates” assist the re-use of complex management scripts by bundling commonly-used collections of rules with an interface through which key parameters can be input by a simulation builder. Standard issues relating to parameter estimation and uncertainty apply to management sub-models and need to be addressed. Techniques for embodying farmers' expectations and plans for the future within modelling analyses need to be further developed, especially better linking planning- and rule-based approaches to farm management and analysing the ways that managers can learn.},

	abstract = {A modular approach to simulation modelling offers significant advantages for its application to agricultural and environmental questions, including re-use of model equations in different contexts and with different user-interfaces; configuration of model structures that are most appropriate to a given problem; and facilitation of collaboration between modelling teams. This paper describes the Common Modelling Protocol (CMP), a generic, open and platform-independent framework for modular simulation modelling that is in widespread use. The CMP is distinguished from existing simulation frameworks by taking an explicitly hierarchical view of the biophysical system being simulated and by representing continuous and discontinuous processes equally naturally. Modules of model logic are represented in the CMP by entities known as "components". Each component may possess "properties" that convey the value of the quantities in its equations and "event handlers" that compute model logic. Low-level information-transfers in the CMP are carried out by means of a message-passing system. Co-ordinated sequences of messages carry out tasks such as initialization, exchange of variable values and the control of computation order. Extensible Markup Language (XML) is used in the protocol for tasks such as denoting data types, submitting simulations for execution and describing components to user-interface software. Examples are presented showing how the CMP can be used to couple modules developed by different teams and to configure a complex model structure. The choices and trade-offs encountered when building a framework for modular simulation are analyzed, using the CMP and other simulation frameworks as examples. The kinds of scientific issues that arise when the CMP is used to realize collaboration between modelling groups are discussed.},

It combines the familiar System Dynamics (compartment-flow) paradigm with an object-based paradigm, allowing many forms of disaggregation to be handled, as well as spatial modelling and individual-based modelling. Its visual modelling interface makes it accessible to non-programmers, at the same time allowing models to be largely self-documenting. Models can be run very efficiently as compiled C++ programs, and users can develop new visualisation tools for displaying model results. Simile has been used in international research programmes, including the modelling of Mediterranean vegetation dynamics and modelling the interaction between households and land at the forest margin in developing countries. Simile has been developed in a spirit of open standards for model sharing. Models are saved as a text file in a structured format, with a view to enable model sharing with other modelling environments and to encourage others to develop additional tools for working with models.},

	abstract = {Seasonal climate forecasting offers potential for improving management of crop production risks in the cropping systems of NE Australia. But how is this capability best connected to management practice? Over the past decade, we have pursued participative systems approaches involving simulation-aided discussion with advisers and decision-makers. This has led to the development of discussion support software as a key vehicle for facilitating infusion of forecasting capability into practice. In this paper, we set out the basis of our approach, its implementation and preliminary evaluation. We outline the development of the discussion support software Whopper Cropper, which was designed for, and in close consultation with, public and private advisers. Whopper Cropper consists of a database of simulation output and a graphical user interface to generate analyses of risks associated with crop management options. The charts produced provide conversation pieces for advisers to use with their farmer clients in relation to the significant decisions they face. An example application, detail of the software development process and an initial survey of user needs are presented. We suggest that discussion support software is about moving beyond traditional notions of supply-driven decision support systems. Discussion support software is largely demand-driven and can compliment participatory action research programs by providing cost-effective general delivery of simulation-aided discussions about relevant management actions. The critical role of farm management advisers and dialogue among key players is highlighted. We argue that the discussion support concept, as exemplified by the software tool Whopper Cropper and the group processes surrounding it, provides an effective means to infuse innovations, like seasonal climate forecasting, into farming practice.},

The inherent model complexity, lack of knowledge about the linkages among model components, scarcity of field data, and uncertainty involved with internal and external factors of the real system call their practical usefulness into doubt. Validation tests designed for such models are just immature, and are argued to have some characteristics that differ from the ones used for validating other types of models. A new approach for testing integrated water systems models is proposed, and applied to test the RaMCo model. Expert knowledge is elicited in the form of qualitative scenarios and translated into quantitative projections using fuzzy set theory. Trend line comparison of the projections made by the RaMCO model and the qualitative projections based on expert knowledge revealed an insufficient number of land-use types adopted by the RaMCo model. This insufficiency makes the model inadequate to describe the consequences of the changes in socio-economic factors and policy options on the erosion from the catchment and the sediment yields at the inlet of a storage lake.},

	abstract = {During the last few years, water has become a limited resource in the southeastern USA. Most farmers, however, are not using any scheduling methods to optimize their irrigation applications. The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of spatially variable irrigation management for a typical soybean field in the Coastal Plain area. The selected field (9.94 ha) had previously been delineated into five spatially variable management zones. For each of the five selected management zones, the soil water limits were estimated from particle size distribution data. Subsequently the plant available soil water was derived from these limits. A process oriented crop model, CROPGRO-Soybean, was used to determine optimal irrigation schedules for each zone, based on 25 years of local historical weather data. The resulting sets of irrigation strategies were then applied to the entire field, with special emphasis on the strategies that (1) produced the highest yield, (2) showed the earliest sign of water stress, or (3) had the largest area. The impact of spatially variable irrigation was analyzed by meeting the optimal irrigation requirements for each zone for all years. Total production, water usage by irrigation, and water drained were calculated for the entire field based on simulation results of each management zone. An economic analysis, using a price of \$222.40 per 1000 kg for soybean and costs of \$1.50, \$2.00, and \$2.50 per ha-cm for irrigation water, was also conducted. Spatially variable irrigation resulted in the best management option. Among the uniform irrigation strategies, management according to the requirements of the largest zone gave the best response. The differences between the best and worst management option were relatively small, i.e. \$16/ha. Although this projected benefit is low for the small field, benefits for large center pivot irrigation systems would be attractive to farmers. The approach used in this study is an excellent method to analyze spatially variable irrigation management strategies under weather uncertainty.},

	abstract = {In this paper we investigate the robustness of a dynamic model, which describes the dynamic of the seagrass Zostera marina, with respect to the inter-annual variability of the two main forcing functions of primary production models in eutrophicated environments. The model was previously applied to simulate the seasonal evolution of this species in the Lagoon of Venice during a specific year and calibrated against time series of field data. In the this paper, we present and discuss the results which were obtained by forcing the model using time series of site-specific daily values concerning the solar radiation intensity and water temperature. The latter was estimated by means of a regression model, whose input variable was a site-specific time series of the air temperature. The regression model was calibrated using a year-long time series of hourly observations. The Z. marina model was first partially recalibrated against the same data set that was used in the original paper. Subsequently, the model was forced using a 7-year-long time series of the driving functions, in order to check the reliability of its long-term predictions. Even though the calibration gave satisfactory results, the multi-annual trends of the output variables were found to be in contrast with the observed evolution of the seagrass biomasses. Since detailed information about the air temperature and solar radiation are often available, these findings suggest that the testing of the ecological consistency of the evolution of primary production models in the long term would provide additional confidence in their results, particularly in those cases in which the scarcity of field data does not allow one to perform a formal corroboration/validation of these models.},

AgMIP protocols emphasize the use of multiple models; consequently, data harmonization is essential. This interoperability was achieved by establishing a data exchange mechanism with variables defined in accordance with international standards; implementing a flexibly structured data schema to store experimental data; and designing a method to fill gaps in model-required input data. Researchers and modelers are able to use these tools to run an ensemble of models on a single, harmonized dataset. This allows them to compare models directly, leading ultimately to model improvements. An important outcome is the development of a platform that facilitates researcher collaboration from many organizations, across many countries. This would have been very difficult to achieve without the AgMIP data interoperability standards described in this paper.},

The example that motivates this review is the application of models for forest carbon accounting. As negotiations determine the terms under which forest carbon will be accounted, reported, and potentially traded, guidelines and standards are being developed to ensure consistency, accuracy, transparency and verifiability. To date, these guidelines have focused on definitions, data, and reporting, not models. The goal of this paper is to synthesize literature that may inform the development of guidelines for the application of models in areas with policy implications, such as forest carbon accounting. We discuss validation, verification, and evaluation as applied to modeling, and review common components of model evaluation. Peer review, quantitative analysis of model results, and sensitivity analysis are the most widely used approaches to model evaluation. US judicial and legislative perspectives on criteria for model acceptability are summarized.},

	abstract = {APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator) is a software system which provides a flexible structure for the simulation of climatic and soil management effects on growth of crops in farming systems and changes in the soil resource. The focus of this paper is the predictive performance of APSIM for simulation of soil water and nitrate nitrogen in contrasting soils (vertisols and alfisols) and environments. The three APSIM modules that determine the dynamics of water, carbon, and nitrogen in the soil system (viz. SOILWAT, SOILN and RESIDUE v.1) are described in terms of the processes represented, with particular emphasis on aspects of their coding that differ from their precursors in CERES and PERFECT. The most fundamental change is in SOILN, which now provides a formal balance of both carbon and nitrogen in the soil and includes a labile soil organic matter pool that decomposes more rapidly than the bulk of the soil organic matter. Model performance, in terms of prediction of soil water and nitrate, is evaluated during fallows, thereby avoiding complications arising from water use and nitrogen uptake by a crop. One data set is from a long-term experiment on a vertisol in southeast Queensland which studied two tillage treatments (conventional and zero tillage) in combination with fertiliser nitrogen inputs for the growth of wheat; soil water and nitrate were measured twice each year (pre-planting and post-harvest). The second comes from experiments at Katherine, Northern Territory, where legume leys growing on alfisols were chemically killed and ensuing changes in soil water and nitrate were measured during a single season. For both datasets, the predictive ability of the model was satisfactory for water and nitrate, in terms of both the total amounts in the whole profile and their distribution with depth. Since neither of these datasets included measurements of the runoff component of the water balance, this aspect of model performance was evaluated, and shown to be generally good, using data from a third source where runoff had been measured from contour bay catchments.},

	abstract = {Several modern development environments allow executable components, such as hydrologic models, to carry metadata describing the properties and capabilities of the components. These metadata may be restricted to the names of variables, and their respective data types, or may extend to other information, such as classification of variables (e.g. input or output), numeric constraints on parameters (e.g. between 0 and 1, or greater than 0) or aliases (e.g. rainfall, also known as precipitation). Introspection in these environments allows tool developers to write programs and other components that make use of these metadata to provide generic model processing tools, while allowing model developers to take advantage of these tools without additional development effort. Typical model processing tools include model integration systems, parameter optimisers, automatic user interface generation and automated IO. One approach to implementing model introspection and metadata, used by the Interactive Component Modelling System (ICMS), is to extract information from a model when compiling a custom modelling language. An alternate approach, applied in a new modelling framework, relies on the language independent introspection provided by the .NET environment. These uses of introspection streamline model development within modelling frameworks, reducing the effort required to take advantage of other framework capabilities, such as dynamic visualisation. Introspection based systems, while introducing flexibility, defer until runtime various type checks that are typically performed by a language compiler. This introduces a performance penalty that may become significant in some circumstances.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present definitions of modularity and genericness that are based on sets of criteria and rules for model design and which encompass the goal of developing an efficient and flexible structure for plant and ecosystem models. Model structure should be based on modules that (1) relate directly to real world components or processes; (2) have input and output variables that are measurable values; and (3) communicate solely via these input and output variables. Such a model structure has the advantage that it can be incrementally improved by simply replacing one module with another that has the same input and output variables. The underlying mechanism in the replacement module can be different, which facilitates the incorporation of the latest experimental research results and allows modulers to readily test alternative hypotheses about mechanisms. Thus, modularity and genericness open models to contributions from many authors, facilitate the comparison of alternative hypotheses, and extend the life and utility of simulation models.},

	abstract = {Natural resource indicators are used by catchment management organisations as targets for land use management. However, the nature of the trade-off function between natural resource management (NRM) outcomes and whole-farm profit is ill-defined, and varies between regions and according to the particular NRM indicator considered. Defining this function will assist catchment management organisations and farmers to evaluate the achievability of particular targets, and help determine the size of economic incentives required to offset any expected loss in farm profit associated with meeting targets. We addressed this issue by modelling representative farm businesses in two mixed farming regions (southern New South Wales and the central wheatbelt of Western Australia). The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) and GRAZPLAN farming systems models were linked and used to generate values of four NRM indicators (water leakage, nitrate leaching, groundcover and soil organic carbon change) for a wide range of crop–pasture rotations. The NRM indicator values were then incorporated into the Model of an Integrated Dryland System (MIDAS) whole-farm economic model to define the relationship with farm profit and farm cropping percentage. For some circumstances and indicators, the resulting trade-off functions were relatively flat; a wide range of enterprise mixes can lead to the same NRM outcomes but significant gains in the indicators may not be possible using current rotation options. For others, significant improvements could be achieved but at a substantial loss in whole-farm profit (through the selection of less profitable rotations). There were also examples where simultaneous gains in indicators and farm profit were possible. This analysis demonstrates an approach by which biophysical simulation models of the farming system can be linked to linear-programming representations of farming enterprises, and provides a method for deriving relationships between NRM targets and economic performance.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.agee.2015.05.005},
	abstract = {The winter wheat- summer maize rotation is the main cropping system in the North China Plain (NCP). While its productivity has been constantly increased, the sustainability of the double cropping system has been increasingly questioned due to the high resource use and negative environmental impact. This paper combined field data with scenario modelling to investigate the productivity, resource (water and nitrogen) use efficiency and environmental impact of the wheat-maize rotation in response to management changes at a representative site Wuqiao in NCP. In addition the potential options to increase the system's eco-efficiency, i.e., producing more with less input and less negative impact on the environment were explored. The results show that 180 kg/ha/year of nitrogen could be considered as the optimal N rate for summer maize. For the wheat-maize double cropping rotation, 225 mm of irrigation water for wheat and 330 kg N/ha (150 for wheat and 180 for maize) are required to maintain the potential grain yield at 18 t/ha and to have minimum impact on environment in terms of N leaching to the groundwater and N loss due to denitrification. These derived rates are 175 mm/year less and 120 kg N/ha less than the highest irrigation and N rates currently practiced. The reduced water and N inputs could reduce the annual totals of drainage, N leaching and denitrification N loss to a minimum of 117 mm, 12 kg N/ha and 28 kg N/ha, respectively. Our simulation results also enabled derivation of yield response curves to water and nitrogen inputs, which can be used to optimise N applications under various levels of irrigation water inputs.

	abstract = {This paper describes the physiological basis and validation of a generic legume model as it applies to 4 species: chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), mungbean (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek), peanut (Arachis hypogaeaL.), and lucerne (Medicago sativa L.). For each species, the key physiological parameters were derived from the literature and our own experimentation. The model was tested on an independent set of experiments, predominantly from the tropics and subtropics of Australia, varying in cultivar, sowing date, water regime (irrigated or dryland), row spacing, and plant population density. The model is an attempt to simulate crop growth and development with satisfactory comprehensiveness, without the necessity of defining a large number of parameters. A generic approach was adopted in recognition of the common underlying physiology and simulation approaches for many legume species. Simulation of grain yield explained 77, 81, and 70\% of the variance (RMSD = 31, 98, and 46 g/m2) for mungbean (n = 40, observed mean = 123 g/m2), peanut (n = 30, 421 g/m2), and chickpea (n = 31, 196 g/m2), respectively. Biomass at maturity was simulated less accurately, explaining 64, 76, and 71\% of the variance (RMSD = 134, 236, and 125 g/m2) for mungbean, peanut, and chickpea, respectively. RMSD for biomass in lucerne (n = 24) was 85 g/m2 with an R2 of 0.55. Simulation accuracy is similar to that achieved by single-crop models and suggests that the generic approach offers promise for simulating diverse legume species without loss of accuracy or physiological rigour.},

	abstract = {The ecological literature reveals considerable confusion about the meaning of validation in the context of simulation models. The confusion arises as much from semantic and philosophical considerations as from the selection of validation procedures. Validation is not a procedure for testing scientific theory or for certifying the `truth' of current scientific understanding, nor is it a required activity of every modelling project. Validation means that a model is acceptable for its intended use because it meets specified performance requirements.Before validation is undertaken, (1) the purpose of the model, (2) the performance criteria, and (3) the model context must be specified. The validation process can be decomposed into several components: (1) operation, (2) theory, and (3) data. Important concepts needed to understand the model evaluation process are verification, calibration, validation, credibility, and qualification. These terms are defined in a limited technical sense applicable to the evaluation of simulation models, and not as general philosophical concepts. Different tests and standards are applied to the operational, theoretical, and data components. The operational and data components can be validated; the theoretical component cannot.The most common problem with ecological and environmental models is failure to state what the validation criteria are. Criteria must be explicitly stated because there are no universal standards for selecting what test procedures or criteria to use for validation. A test based on comparison of simulated versus observed data is generally included whenever possible. Because the objective and subjective components of validation are not mutually exclusive, disagreements over the meaning of validation can only be resolved by establishing a convention.},

	abstract = {Phenological development is the most important attribute of crop adaptation and long-term changes in phenology provide strong evidence of the biological impact of warmer climates. This paper takes the documented increase in temperature during the last decades as a starting point, and quantifies the changes in wheat phenology in (a) 53 locations in eastern Australia between 1957 and 2000 using the APSIM model, and (b) 17 locations in the Pampas between 1971 and 2000, using CERES-Wheat. The expectation is shortened season length associated with warmer climate; the aim is to quantify the actual magnitude of phenological changes, the relative changes in the duration of pre- and post-flowering phases, and the interaction between changing temperature and sowing date. Modelled time from sowing to maturity was reduced up to similar to 0.3 d y(-1); time to flowering accounted for most of the variation in time to maturity. The rate of change in the duration of modelled wheat phenophases was more marked with early sowing. Owing to the cumulative effect of temperature on crop development assumed in the models, significant changes in rate of development were detected in some cases when change in temperature was statistically undetected. A minimum rate of mean temperature increase similar to 0.02 degrees C y(-1) was required for significant shortening of time to flowering and season length. In agreement with rates derived from field experiments, the rate of change in modelled time to flowering and maturity was approximate to 7 d degrees C-1. The duration of the post-flowering phase was largely unchanged. This was associated with lack of change in temperature, or where temperature increased, earlier flowering that shifted post-flowering development to relatively cooler conditions, thus neutralising the trend of increasing temperature.

In this paper an integrated approach to the quality improvement problem is proposed. This approach incorporates project management, good practice in software engineering and improvement of the simulation modeling process (SMP) in particular. The SMP has to be optimized by means of a model (QUASIMODEM) of the SMP. QUASIMODEM will facilitate the intended improvements through five stages of the upgrading process.

	abstract = {Relational databases are increasingly used to manage large and complex experimental datasets. This technology was chosen to create a common database tool for a large multi-site experiment which measured aspects of the sustainability of various regionally focused grazing experiments, as part of the Sustainable Grazing Systems Program. Since the data needs of experiments expanded over time and the number of sites and subsites increased, it was necessary to adopt an evolutionary approach to creating the database. It was important that the database be customised to accommodate the wide range of experiments and the diverse needs of the many scientists involved and yet have complete conformity of structure to permit across-site queries. This paper describes the steps taken in this process and suggests how similar database projects could be implemented more efficiently in the future. As most of the scientists involved were initially new users of relational databases, there were some delays in achieving full adoption of a uniform approach to data handling. The software chosen was a commonly available desktop application which was modified using code developed to allow graphical queries, quality assurance of data, and interfacing with a purpose-built simulation model. A survey of users at the end of the project indicated that there was generally a high degree of satisfaction with the relational database developed, but it also identified areas requiring improvement. The need for developing mechanisms of sharing data and of protecting data for possible future use are briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {The traditional code-based modelling approach in agriculture and ecology has many strengths, particularly in terms of model flexibility, efficiency and power. Nonetheless code-based programming is a specialist skill and a barrier to simulation modelling to most scientists and students. Icon-based modelling systems on the other hand are easy to use and learn and have opened up simulation modelling to a much broader group of researchers. However there are limitations to the flexibility of these modelling systems and sometimes the size and complexity of models that can be constructed in them.One approach by which researchers can gain the best of both types of models is by linking icon-based models to code-based models within a modular modelling framework. By developing largely self-contained modules that communicate with other modules solely by means of defined input/output variables, modules can be developed in an easy to use icon-based modelling system and subsequently `plugged in' to a larger code-based model. In this paper, we demonstrate this approach using VensimTM to develop a new seed bank module for the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM). In an example application we compare the persistence of two hypothetical annual pasture plants with differing life histories under two contrasting farming systems.This approach has the benefits of: (i) rapid and efficient model development that allows specialist scientists and programmers to focus on their respective areas of expertise; (ii) ongoing maintenance and development of modules by science specialists without need for constant recourse to programmers; (iii) ease of sharing, exchange and comparison of icon-based modules between researchers; and, (iv) ease of communication of model structure.},

	abstract = {Multiple cropping systems are particularly important in China to feed the 19\% of the world's population with only 8\% of the arable land. Rising temperatures can dramatically affect multiple cropping systems and, as a consequence, food security in China. Here, we investigate the impacts of climate change on the northern limits and crop planting areas of multiple cropping systems in China, and estimate the impacts of the change in the crop planting areas of multiple cropping systems on the China's crop production (maize, wheat, and rice). Based on both historical climate observations from the China Meteorological Administration and future climate A1B emission scenario (IPCC, 2007) data for China, we evaluate the effects of climate change on multiple cropping systems in China. Historical statistical crop yield and simulated crop yield by Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM model) in 2011-2100 were used to quantify the crop production (maize, wheat, and rice) in China. We found that the northern limits of multiple cropping systems have been shifted northward. The projected area of cultivated land for triple-cropping system may significantly expand during the 21st century. The northern shifts resulted in a 2.2\% (similar to 8,000,000 t) increase in national production of three major crops (maize, wheat, and rice) during the period from 1981 to 2010, positively impacting China's food security. Therefore, we conclude that the warming due to climate change may cause a positive impact on the crop production in China if concomitant changes adapted in multiple cropping systems take place.

	abstract = {Abstract Pastoral systems are characterised by a number of features that are absent in arable cropping systems. These features include: (i) pastures are biologically diverse so interactions between plant species must be considered; (ii) economic return requires the inclusion of the animal as an additional trophic level; (iii) interaction between the grazing animal and the pasture is complex, influenced by the environment, plant species and animal behaviour and this creates feedbacks that can result in vicious cycles; (iv) animals spatially transfer substantial amounts of nutrients both randomly and systematically and this creates or exacerbates soil variability; and (v) whole farm management is both more complex and more important to system function in grazed compared to arable systems and it is harder to capture in simulation models. These challenges complicate the process-based modelling of pastoral systems and present significant obstacles to model developers and users. Here we discuss these challenges, describe the range of solutions used by different models and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these solutions. We have placed particular emphasis on the analysis of a range of possible solutions with the point of view that diversity between and within models is important to provide the flexibility needed for future uses. We find that for most challenges there is a diversity of solutions incorporated into the models and that there is the potential to capture additional diversity, if needed, from other models. We note an apparent lack of development in the modelling of extreme events such as very high temperatures, systematic animal-mediated nutrient transfers, pests, weeds and gene-environment interactions in pastoral simulation models and suggest that these subject areas should receive more attention.},

The development of CropSyst started in the early 1990s, evolving to a suite of programs including a cropping systems simulator (CropSyst), a weather generator (ClimGen), GIS-CropSyst cooperator program (ArcCS), a watershed model (CropSyst Watershed), and several miscellaneous utility programs. CropSyst and associated programs can be downloaded free of charge over the Internet. One key feature of CropSyst is the implementation of a generic crop simulator that enables the simulation of both yearly and multi-year crops and crop rotations via a single set of parameters. Simulations can last a fraction of a year to hundreds of years. The model has been evaluated in many world locations by comparing model estimates to data collected in field experiments. CropSyst has been applied to perform risk and economic analyses of scenarios involving different cropping systems, management options, and soil and climatic conditions.

	abstract = {In lucerne, a dynamic fraction of total daily assimilates is allocated to the root system and the amount partitioned differs in response to seasonal environmental stimuli. This study proposes a simple framework to quantify this dynamic for inclusion in lucerne simulation models. The framework incorporates recent findings on radiation-use efficiency, radiation interception, and dry matter (DM) partitioning to shoots and roots in response to environmental factors. Results showed that the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between observed and simulated values was 20\% of the mean for shoot biomass and 24\% for leaf area index. However, there was systematic bias (73\% of RMSD) between observed and simulated root biomass (RMSD = 35\%). This was caused by the initial assumption of a constant rate for root maintenance respiration (Rm) of 0.015 g/g.day in the model calculations. Sensitivity analysis, with constant Rm values that ranged from 0.005 to 0.030 g/g.day, failed to improve the prediction of root biomass. The modelling exercise suggested the existence of a systematic pattern of change in Rm from 0.035 g/g.day in summer to {\textless}0.005 g/g.day in winter. When this seasonality was incorporated, the accuracy of root DM simulations improved (RMSD = 14\%). The possible existence of a seasonal Rm in lucerne, unveiled by this modelling approach, needs to be validated with an independent dataset.},

	abstract = {Grazing crop stubbles affects soil structure, groundcover, and the productivity of subsequent crops, but the cost of this practice is highly variable and not easily compared against the value of feed provided to livestock. To compare with and without grazing stubbles in terms of whole-farm profit and water-use efficiency we created a mixed enterprise farm model using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator and GRAZPLAN biophysical simulation submodels, and the Model of Integrated Dryland Agricultural System linear programming model. We hypothesised that grazing crop stubbles would increase farm profit by an amount equivalent to the value of the metabolisable energy (ME) consumed by sheep when they grazed the crop stubbles. Representative mixed farms where sheep were or were not allowed to graze crop stubbles were compared for two locations in the wheatbelt of Western Australia (Cunderdin and Geraldton) at two stocking rates. Across locations and stocking rates, the estimated value of the ME intake from crop stubbles was 2.2 times the increase in farm gross margin when stubble grazing was allowed. Contributing to this difference was that stubble grazing provided a less flexible feed source than supplementary feeding and in the absence of adjustments in stocking rates sheep tended to utilise more of the annual and permanent pastures when stubble grazing was not permitted. Therefore, the value of grazing crop stubbles to the profitability of the farm enterprise was overestimated by the ME value of the intake. Owing to reduced consumption of supplementary feed by livestock, whole-farm water-use efficiency of protein production was increased by 15\% when grazing of crop stubbles was permitted. This simulation study shows that the value of grazing crop stubbles cannot be predicted well using energy intake from stubble grazing or reduced supplementary feeding costs.},

	abstract = {Abstract A novel geospatial tool box named Geospatial Simulation (GeoSim) has been developed, which can be used to manage point-based model simulations at multiple locations using geospatial data within a geographic information system (GIS). The objectives of this paper were to describe GeoSim and demonstrate its use. GeoSim has been developed as a plug-in for Quantum GIS, and both of these software programs are open-source and freely available. An important feature of GeoSim is its model-independent nature, meaning any point-based simulation model that uses ASCII files for input and output can be managed spatially. GeoSim facilitates the transfer of geospatial data from the GIS database to the model input files and from the model output files back to the GIS database. GeoSim presently includes six software tools, each with a graphical user interface. A case study demonstrates the use of GeoSim for processing geospatial data layers at a field site, conducting spatial model simulations, and optimizing model parameters for site-specific conditions. Two cropping system models, AquaCrop and the DSSAT Cropping System Model, were implemented to simulate seed cotton yield in response to irrigation management, nitrogen management, and soil texture variability for a 14 ha study area near Lamesa, Texas. Geoprocessing tools within GeoSim were able to summarize 5592 data points within 405 polygon features in 3.8 s. Simulation tools were able to swap 33,316 and 44,550 parameters values to complete 405 spatial simulations with the AquaCrop and DSSAT models in 112 s and 398 s, respectively. These results demonstrate the utility of GeoSim for summarizing large geospatial data sets and transferring the data to the file formats of multiple models. Simulation duration was increased as compared to stand-alone model simulations without parameter swapping, which may be problematic for applications requiring large numbers of simulations. The flexible design of GeoSim is intended to support spatial modeling exercises for a variety of models and environmental applications.},

	abstract = {Both anticipated climate change and dryland salinity pose a strategic threat to the sustainability of about 6 Mha of agricultural land in Western Australia (WA). These phenomena require an integrated analysis to estimate their potential impacts and initiate strategic thinking about adaptation. Water loss below the root zone, i.e. deep drainage, is the primary cause of sub-soil salt mobilisation leading to surface soil salinity in areas cleared of natural vegetation in Australia; hence deep drainage is an important externality of agricultural production. The purpose of this paper is to show how changes in CO2 concentration, temperature and precipitation may affect agricultural production and deep drainage. Results are presented of a simulation experiment with the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM)-Nwheat model in which we explored sensitivity of (1) wheat production and quality, and (2) deep drainage, for three sites in WA differing in average precipitation, two soils, various nitrogenous fertiliser rates and present wheat cultivars. Since results of Global Circulation Models (GCM) are still largely inconsistent for this region, we have opted for a factorial approach in adapting 90 years of historical weather data. This set-up enabled separation of effects Of CO2, temperature, precipitation and their interactions, and unravelling of the complex interactions between water and nitrogen availability, phenological development and climate change factors, in the extremely variable Mediterranean climate in WA. Elevated CO2 concentration increased yields, particularly if nitrogen fertilisation was sufficient and conditions were relatively dry. Higher temperatures had non-linear effects, with initial (up to 3 degreesC) benefits on clay soils, but not on sandy soils, and then substantial yield declines. Both elevated CO2 concentrations and temperatures (+3 degreesC) decreased grain protein, but in financial terms this was more than offset by the increase in yield in most cases. If, in addition, precipitation was decreased, financial returns dropped below present levels, particularly in the low precipitation regions. Deep drainage tended to be slightly higher under elevated CO2 concentrations but when higher temperatures were also simulated this was reversed. Deep drainage was greatly reduced in the low precipitation scenarios. Evidently climate change is not only likely to affect productivity, but also deep drainage and hence dryland salinity. The impact can vary in direction such that both 'win-win' and 'lose-win' outcomes may occur, particularly depending on the relative change in precipitation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Since the pioneering work of C.T. de Wit in the 1960s, the Wageningen group has built a tradition in developing and applying crop models. Rather than focusing on a few models, diversity is its trademark. Here we present an overview of the Wageningen crop and crop-soil modelling approaches along three criteria. The first criterion relates to the production situations the models are dealing with (i.e. potential, water and/or nutrient-limited, and actual production situations including pests, diseases and weeds). Second, models differ as a result of the objectives of model development, and hence required scale and degree of detail and comprehensiveness. Third, models have at least three potential application domains, i.e. research, education and support of learning and decision making processes.We describe both summary and more comprehensive modelling approaches for the major production situations. An overview of most of the Wageningen models is presented together with a more detailed description of LINTUL, SUCROS, ORYZA, WOFOST and INTERCOM. Illustrations for each of the three application domains are presented, i.e. plant type design, guiding experimental research, education, yield gap analysis, evaluation of manure policies, crop growth monitoring system and analysis and design of farming and regional land use systems. We discuss common issues of model verification, model validation, model validity and data requirements, and present information on software implementation, model and software documentation and distribution policy. Finally, we reflect upon the Wageningen modelling approaches and identify a number of key issues for future research.Major achievements of Wageningen modelling efforts include (1) a broad variety of approaches for modelling of systems at different scales and with different purposes; (2) their contribution to quantitative systems thinking in general, also for applications at higher hierarchical levels; (3) a strong linkage between crop modelling and higher education, both at undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral level. To continually increase our understanding of crops and production systems a diversified approach must be cherished. At the same time we conclude that focus is required on a limited number of modules in a more integrated modelling framework for the benefit of analysing, evaluating and designing cropping systems. This review may be instrumental in the development of such an integrated framework.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.agrformet.2015.03.018},
	abstract = {High-temperature episodes are known to be damaging to the reproductive mechanisms of crop plants such as wheat. This damage results in a decrease in wheat yields. This study used statistical modeling, three-dimensional (3-D) plots and the Agricultural Production System Simulator (APSIM) to analyze historical wheat yield records in southern New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The aim was to quantify the effects of reproductive stage high-temperature episodes on yields and to compare the predictions of the statistical model with those of APSIM. From the statistical model, it was found that high-degree hours (HDH), a measure of the number of hours that temperatures were above a threshold level during the reproductive stages, always had a negative effect on yields. Furthermore, growing season rainfall, up to approximately 30\% above average, had a positive effect. Multi-variable analysis indicated that HDH had the largest negative effect when growing season rainfall was 5-45\% below average. In the warmer/drier northwestern shires, there was an average 15\% yearly yield reduction due to HDH. Over the whole area, there was an average 5.3\% yield reduction for each 1 degrees C rise in growing season average daily temperature. Averaged across the six shires, high HDH values, which would normally be associated with reproductive system damage, did not affect the accuracy of the APSIM predictions. When the statistical model predictions and the APSIM simulation predictions were tested against a later independent set (1982-2008) of weather data and observed yield records, the predictions of the statistical model (RMSE = 14.6) were more accurate than those of APSIM (RMSE = 18.9). In conclusion, when suitable climate and yield datasets are available, a combination of statistical modeling and 3-D plots is a useful way to separate the effects of high-temperature episodes and rainfall on wheat yields and identify a rainfall range where high-temperature episodes are most damaging to yields.

	abstract = {Pearl millet (Pennisteum americanum L.) is an essential crop in farming systems of the dry areas of the semi-arid tropics and its tillering habit is an important adaptive feature. This is the first paper in a series aiming at developing and validating a pearl millet simulation model that recognises tillers as functional entities, analogous to intercrops. The objective of this paper is to quantify the effects of total leaf number per axis (TLN), cultivar, plant density and axis number on parameters that are used to simulate potential leaf area per plant. Four cultivars with different phenology and tillering habit were grown under well-watered and well-fertilised conditions at two locations in India, covering a range of daylengths and plant densities. For selected plants, the area of fully expanded leaves was measured non-destructively. A bell-shaped function adequately described the relationship between individual leaf area and leaf position on an axis. Its shape was determined by the position (X0) and area (Y0) of the largest leaf and by the breadth and skewness of the leaf area profile curve. TLN affected all four parameters, although the association with Y0 was weak. Cultivar only affected Y0, suggesting that parameterising new cultivars is straightforward. The observed density effect confirmed that competition for light between axes started during stem elongation. The results highlighted the consistent differences between leaf area profiles of main shoots and tillers. For a high-tillering crop like pearl millet, modelling leaf area dynamics through individual leaves is justified, as this approach can potentially deal with cultivar and environmental effects on tillering.},

The steps consist in the simulation of development of the green crop canopy cover, crop transpiration, above-ground biomass, and final crop yield. Temperature and water stresses directly affect one or more of the above processes. Nutrient deficiencies and salinity effects are simulated indirectly by moderating canopy cover development over the season, and by reducing crop transpiration and the normalized water productivity. The effect of CO2 concentration on biomass is simulated by altering the normalized water productivity. The model requires a relatively small number of explicit parameter values and mostly intuitive input variables. The paper describes the essence of AquaCrop Version 4.0, applications and parameterization of crops, crop responses to elevated CO2 concentration, soil fertility and salinity, and further model developments.},

We show that the model squared error for predictions averaged over space or time will always be smaller than average squared prediction error and how to estimate the difference between the two, using commonly available data. We illustrate with two case studies concerning irrigation management, (where major interest is in yield averaged over years) and nitrous oxide emissions (where major interest is in emissions averaged over a growing season). Squared error of the average was estimated to be only 57\% and 10\% of the average squared error for the irrigation and nitrous oxide emissions studies, respectively, in the limit of averaging over long times.},

	abstract = {The Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator, APSIM, is a cropping system modelling environment that simulates the dynamics of soil-plant-management interactions within a single crop or a cropping system. Adaptation of previously developed crop models has resulted in multiple crop modules in APSIM, which have low scientific transparency and code efficiency. A generic crop model template (GCROP) has been developed to capture unifying physiological principles across crops (plant types) and to provide modular and efficient code for crop modelling. It comprises a standard crop interface to the APSIM engine, a generic crop model structure, a crop process library, and well-structured crop parameter files. The process library contains the major science underpinning the crop models and incorporates generic routines based on physiological principles for growth and development processes that are common across crops. It allows APSIM to simulate different crops using the same set of computer code. The generic model structure and parameter files provide an easy way to test, modify, exchange and compare modelling approaches at process level without necessitating changes in the code. The standard interface generalises the model inputs and outputs, and utilises a standard protocol to communicate with other APSIM modules through the APSIM engine. The crop template serves as a convenient means to test new insights and compare approaches to component modelling, while maintaining a focus on predictive capability. This paper describes and discusses the scientific basis, the design, implementation and future development of the crop template in APSIM. On this basis, we argue that the combination of good software engineering with sound crop science can enhance the rate of advance in crop modelling.},

	abstract = {The study used a modelling approach to assess the potential impacts of likely climate change and increase in CO(2) concentration on the wheat growth and water balance in Murray-Darling Basin in Australia. Impacts of individual changes in temperature, rainfall or CO(2) concentration as, well as the 2050 and 2070 climate change scenarios, were analysed. Along an E-W transect, wheat yield at western sites (warmer and drier) was simulated to be more sensitive to temperature increase than that at eastern sites; along the S-N transect, wheat yield at northern warmer sites was simulated to be more sensitive to temperature increase, within 1-3A degrees C temperature increase. Along the E-W and S-N transects, wheat at drier sites would benefit more from elevated [CO(2)] than at wetter sites, but more sensitive to the decline in rainfall. The increase in temperature only did not have much impact on water balance. Elevated [CO(2)] increased the drainage in all the sites, whilst rainfall reduction decreased evapotranspiration, runoff and drainage, especially at drier sites. In 2050, wheat yield would increase by 1-10\% under all climate change scenarios along the S-N transect, except for the northernmost site (Dalby). Along the E-W transect, the most obvious increase of wheat yields under all climate change scenarios occurred in cooler and wetter eastern sites (Yass and Young), with an average increase rate of 7\%. The biggest loss occurred at the driest sites (Griffith and Swan Hill) under A1FI and B2 scenarios, ranging from -5\% to -16\%. In 2070, there would be an increased risk of yield loss in general, except for the cool and wet sites. Water use efficiency was simulated to increase at most of the study sites under all the climate change scenarios, except for the driest site. Yield variability would increase at drier sites (Ardlethan, Griffith and Swan Hill). Soil types would also impact on the response of wheat yield and water balance to future climate change.},

	abstract = {A simulation study was carried out to assess the potential sensitivity of wheat growth and water balance components to likely climate change scenarios at Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia. Specific processes considered include crop development, growth rate, grain yield, water use efficiency, evapotranspiration, runoff and deep drainage. Individual impacts of changes in temperature, rainfall and CO(2) concentration ([CO(2)]) and the combined impacts of these three variables were analysed for 2050 ([CO(2)] = 570 ppm, T +2.3A degrees C, P -7\%) and 2070 ([CO(2)] = 720 ppm, T +3.8A degrees C, P -10\%) conditions. Two different rainfall change scenarios (changes in rainfall intensity or rainfall frequency) were used to modify historical rainfall data. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) was used to simulate the growth and water balan-- ce processes for a 117 year period of baseline, 2050 and 2070 climatic conditions. The results showed that wheat yield reduction caused by 1A degrees C increase in temperature and 10\% decrease in rainfall could be compensated by a 266 ppm increase in [CO(2)] assuming no interactions between the individual effects. Temperature increase had little impact on long-term average water balance, while [CO(2)] increase reduced evapotranspiration and increased deep drainage. Length of the growing season of wheat decreased 22 days in 2050 and 35 days in 2070 conditions as a consequence of 2.3A degrees C and 3.8A degrees C increase in temperature respectively. Yield in 2050 was approximately 1\% higher than the simulated baseline yield of 4,462 kg ha (-aEuro parts per thousand 1), but it was 6\% lower in 2070. An early maturing cultivar (Hartog) was more sensitive in terms of yield response to temperature increase, while a mid-maturing cultivar (Janz) was more sensitive to rainfall reduction. Janz could benefit more from increase in CO(2) concentration. Rainfall reduction across all rainfall events would have a greater negative impact on wheat yield and WUE than if only smaller rainfall events reduced in magnitude, even given the same total decrease in annual rainfall. The greater the reduction in rainfall, the larger was the difference. The increase in temperature increased the difference of impact between the two rainfall change scenarios while increase in [CO(2)] reduced the difference.},

	abstract = {In the support of environmental management, models are frequently used. The outcomes of these models however, rarely show a perfect resemblance to the real-world system behavior. This is due to uncertainties, introduced during the process of abstracting information about the system to include it in the model. To provide decision makers with realistic information about these model outcomes, uncertainty analysis is indispensable. Because of the multiplicity of frameworks available for uncertainty analysis, the outcomes of such analyses are rarely comparable. In this paper a method for structured identification and classification of uncertainties in the application of environmental models is presented. We adapted an existing uncertainty framework to enhance the objectivity in the uncertainty identification process. Two case studies demonstrate how it can help to obtain an overview of unique uncertainties encountered in a model. The presented method improves the comparability of uncertainty analyses in different model studies and leads to a coherent overview of uncertainties affecting model outcomes.},

Nitrogen loads are examined using the nitrogen surplus of simulated sugarcane production systems in the Tully-Murray catchment, comparing current management practice regimes with best management practice regimes under present day and future climate scenarios - nominally 2030 and 2070. These future scenarios are represented by increased carbon dioxide, increased temperature and increased rainfall variability. Simulation results suggest that the impact of potential climate change on diffuse agricultural nitrogen loads from sugarcane production in the Tully - Murray catchment to the Great Barrier Reef is likely to be small and negligible in comparison to the impacts of management practice change. Partial gross margin analysis suggests climate change will not noticeably alter the profitability of sugarcane production and, hence, is unlikely to be a driver of change for this land use in the Tully - Murray catchment. Improvements in water quality from sugarcane production are more likely to come from identification and adoption of best management practices.},

The model is Geographic Information System-based and estimates the dynamical water balance using Darcy's Law. The method, which is generally applicable to data-rich aquifers, proved cost and time effective and provided important insights to the groundwater dynamics of the area.

Here we consider calibration of the phenology sub-model of the widely used crop model APSIM-Oryza, using commonly available varietal data. We show that the dynamic phenology sub-model can be well approximated by a static model, with three equations. It is then straightforward to estimate the parameters using any standard statistical software package. The approach is applied to four rice varieties from Sri Lanka. The software provides not only the best-fit parameters, but also uncertainty information about those parameters. This is essential for understanding how well the model will predict out of sample. Here the photoperiod sensitivity coefficient has large uncertainty, and so predictions for day lengths outside the data set are very unreliable. The uncertainty information is also used to show that in our case, doing more field trials would have very little effect on uncertainty. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Winter oilseed rape production is typically characterised by low nitrogen (N) use efficincy. Defining site-specific fertiliser strategies based on field trials and crop modelling may help to improve the ecological efficiency of this crop. However, no model has been evaluated for winter oilseed rape that simulates the growth of the plant as limited by the interaction of water and N. In this study, the APSIM canola model which was originally developed for the temperate regions of Australia, was adapted for conditions in Germany and tested against measured data (total biomass, grain yield, leaf area index, N-uptake and soil mineral N) at three sites near Gottingen (northern Germany). In the second part of the study, the evaluated model was used in a simulation experiment to explore site-specific climate and soil related production limitations to match fertiliser rates to yield targets. Historical weather data from four sites across northern Germany and a fertile loamy soil with different rooting depths, implicating different plant available water capacities, were used. Model results showed large differences in yield (up to 1000 kg ha(-1)) and N-balance ({\textgreater}30 kg ha(-1)) for 200 kg N-fertiliser rate ha(-1) between restricted (50 cm) and unrestricted rooting depths. Simulated yields for such high N-fertiliser rate were lower for sites with continental climate than for sites close to the coast, reflecting different rainfall patterns. Results indicate that water supply plays a critical role when maintaining high N use efficiency and reaching simultaneously grain yields of 4000 kg ha(-1). (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, computing capacity remains a barrier to large-scale, high-resolution agricultural modeling. To model wheat production, soil carbon, and nitrogen dynamics in Australia's cropping regions at a high resolution, we developed a hybrid computing approach combining parallel processing and grid computing. The hybrid approach distributes tasks across a heterogeneous grid computing pool and fully utilizes all the resources of computers within the pool. We simulated 325 management scenarios (nitrogen application rates and stubble management) at a daily time step over 122 years, for 12,707 climate–soil zones using the Windows-based Agricultural Production Systems SIMulator (APSIM). These simulations would have taken over 30 years on a single computer. Our hybrid high performance computing (HPC) approach completed the modeling within 10.5 days—a speed-up of over 1000 times—with most jobs finishing within the first few days. The approach utilizes existing idle organization-wide computing resources and eliminates the need to translate Windows-based models to other operating systems for implementation on computing clusters. There are however, numerous computing challenges that need to be addressed for the effective use of these techniques and there remain several potential areas for further performance improvement. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in making high-resolution modeling of agricultural systems possible over continental and global scales.},

	abstract = {Agricultural systems models worldwide are increasingly being used to explore options and solutions for the food security, climate change adaptation and mitigation and carbon trading problem domains. APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator) is one such model that continues to be applied and adapted to this challenging research agenda. From its inception twenty years ago, APSIM has evolved into a framework containing many of the key models required to explore changes in agricultural landscapes with capability ranging from simulation of gene expression through to multi-field farms and beyond.

Keating et al. (2003) described many of the fundamental attributes of APSIM in detail. Much has changed in the last decade, and the APSIM community has been exploring novel scientific domains and utilising software developments in social media, web and mobile applications to provide simulation tools adapted to new demands.

This paper updates the earlier work by Keating et al. (2003) and chronicles the changing external challenges and opportunities being placed on APSIM during the last decade. It also explores and discusses how APSIM has been evolving to a “next generation” framework with improved features and capabilities that allow its use in many diverse topics.},

	volume = {178},
	doi = {10.1016/j.fcr.2015.03.024},
	abstract = {Aflatoxin is a potent carcinogen produced by Aspergillus flavus, which frequently contaminates maize (Zea mays L.) in the field between 40 north and 40 south latitudes. A mechanistic model to predict risk of pre-harvest contamination could assist in management of this very harmful mycotoxin. In this study we describe an aflatoxin risk prediction model which is integrated with the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) modelling framework. The model computes a temperature function for A. flavus growth and aflatoxin production using a set of three cardinal temperatures determined in the laboratory using culture medium and intact grains. These cardinal temperatures were 11.5 degrees C as base, 32.5 degrees C as optimum and 42.5 degrees C as maximum. The model used a low ({\textless}= 0.2) crop water supply to demand ratio an index of drought during the grain filling stage to simulate maize crop's susceptibility to A. flavus growth and aflatoxin production. When this low threshold of the index was reached the model converted the temperature function into an aflatoxin risk index (ARI) to represent the risk of aflatoxin contamination. The model was applied to simulate ARI for two commercial maize hybrids, H513 and H614D, grown in five multi-location field trials in Kenya using site specific agronomy, weather and soil parameters. The observed mean aflatoxin contamination in these trials varied from {\textless}1 to 7143 ppb. ARI simulated by the model explained 99\% of the variation (p {\textless}= 0.001) in a linear relationship with the mean observed aflatoxin contamination. The strong relationship between ARI and aflatoxin contamination suggests that the model could be applied to map risk prone areas and to monitor in-season risk for genotypes and soils parameterized for APSIM.

	abstract = {Australian dry-land crop producers farm in regions with highly variable climate and soils. Farmers have responded to the pressures of rising costs by pioneering and adapting new technologies to narrow the gap between actual and water-limited yield. With yields reaching a plateau in many of the developed world's cropping areas, it is possible that Australia's leading farmers have similarly closed the exploitable yield gap and require technological breakthroughs to sustainably push the production frontier to new and higher levels. To assess the potential for Australian farmers to continue closing the yield gap, and possibly increase water-limited yield, the long-term farm production records of individual wheat fields of three leading farmers in South East Australia were used to ascertain the applicability of modelling to develop new and innovative practices. The cropping systems simulator APSIM was used to establish the attainable simulated yield based on the farmers' chosen management inputs for wheat crops over a period of 16-20 years. A strong relationship (r(2) = 0.89, RMSD = 508 kg ha(-1)) was found between actual and simulated yields. This relationship indicates that yield-reducing factors not simulated by APSIM (weeds, disease etc.) were largely controlled on these farms and confirms APSIM's suitability for this analysis. Over the 16-20 year study period, the average yield gaps on the three farms ranged from 480 to 770 kg ha(-1); representing between 74 and 82\% of their water-limited yield potential. For these leading farmers, the yield gap is only small and unlikely to be economically exploitable under current management practices. Consequently, three tactical management innovations with potential to improve farm wheat yield and reduce risk were evaluated. One innovation investigated whether farmers practicing no-till crop establishment, who were able to control weeds prior to sowing, could benefit from sowing current cultivars earlier than present-day practice. It was found that leading farmers are already sowing at the optimum time and sowing earlier would not increase yield because of greater risk of frost damage. Two other innovations were found to have practical application. The first used Yield Prophet (R) to assist farmers decide when to apply in-crop nitrogen fertiliser based on a more complete understanding of nitrogen and water requirements of crops in variable growing seasons. The second innovation involved sowing slow maturing wheat cultivars earlier than current practice but only in years with adequate stored soil water and early season rainfall. Both innovations were found to increase grain yield and reduce risk of over- or under-application of nitrogen fertiliser. Investigation of strategic and tactical management options to increase yield using simulation modelling for subsequent evaluation in the field has the potential to keep Australian farmers at the forefront of innovations in crop production.

	abstract = {The uptake of K by crops depends on dynamic interactions between soil and fertiliser K availability, sea, son effects on growth, agronomic management and soil properties. In such complex systems, simulation modelling which accounts for both K supply and demand processes may be the most effective approach to assessing the efficacy of different K fertiliser strategies for crop uptake. We developed a K model for wheat in the crop simulation model APSIM. Reactive solute transport was modelled using the mixing cell approach and root K uptake was modelled based upon the concentration of K in the root system and soil solution and an equilibration between root and shoot concentrations. Photosynthetic assimilation rate and water-use efficiency were modified according to shoot K concentration. The parameter optimisation software PEST was applied to optimise the parameters introduced for this model. Overall the model provided a satisfactory match to the calibration data set for soil surface K, grain yield and shoot K concentration in early growth stages but model predictions were most sensitive to the parameter that describes the shape of the K adsorption isotherm. Evaluation of the calibrated model for an independent data set (n = 807) showed reasonable agreement with maturity biomass (r(2) = 0.73, RMSE= 1666 kg ha(-1)), soil surface K in the year after application (r(2) = 0.72, RMSE= 17 mg kg(-1)), and grain yield (r(2) = 0.66, RMSE = 637 kg ha(-1)). However, it was necessary to modify the grain fill function to include the effect of shoot K concentration on grain filling rate which led to an improvement in grain yield prediction at low K fertiliser rates and in the relative response to K fertiliser application. The current K simulation model provides satisfactory predictions of wheat response to K on sands across a range of seasons. Further improvement could be achieved by evaluation of the solute transport model under field conditions and the grain fill function; both improvements require data sets of wheat K response from experimental sites with well characterised soil water properties.

It will provide access to model source code and an interactive platform for researchers to form a consensus on existing methods, and to synthesize new ideas, which will help to advance progress in this area. The platform will eventually support a variety of models, but to trial the platform and test the architecture and functionality, it was piloted with variants of the DNDC model. The intention is to form a worldwide collaborative network (a virtual laboratory) via an interactive website with access to models and best practice guidelines; appropriate datasets for testing, calibrating and evaluating models; on-line tutorials and links to modelling and data provider research groups, and their associated publications.

	abstract = {Subsurface potassium (K) supply can make a significant contribution to total K uptake in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) although its influence on grain yield response to K fertiliser is unresolved. Previous work has shown that the inclusion of subsurface ({\textgreater}10 cm depth) soil extractable K (SEK) did not improve the prediction of relative yield (RY) compared to a prediction based on SEK in the 0-10 cm soil layer only. Our understanding of the influence of subsurface SEK is constrained by the incomplete nature of the interaction 8 between season x surface SEK x subsurface SEK directly measured in field experiments. To understand these interactions, we simulated wheat growth for two locations in a rain fed environment in south-west Western Australia (SWWA) and two soil types using the crop growth simulation model APSIM, which has been calibrated for the sandy-surfaced soils of SWWA. Sensitivity analysis of the effect of subsurface SEK on grain yield showed that the effectiveness of subsurface SEK relative to surface SEK declined exponentially as the depth of the K-enriched subsurface layer increased. We implemented a Monte Carlo simulation for a deep sand and a sand over clay soil profile for a range of surface SEK levels, subsurface SEK depths, subsurface SEK levels, locations, years, subsurface root constraint and rates of K fertiliser applied. Global sensitivity analysis showed that SEK in the 0-10 cm depth was the most important factor for RY in the deep sand and sand over clay profiles followed by SEK 10-20 cm and location. We used the results from the Monte Carlo simulation to develop a K fertiliser recommendation model based on SEK 0-10 cm only and a recommendation model based on SEK 0-10 cm together with subsurface SEK, root constraint and stored soil water at sowing. A net economic benefit (change in income exceeds extra costs) only occurred in a limited number of scenarios where SEK 0-10 cm was between},

Treatments included CO2 by water, N and temperature. The location represents a semi-arid environment with a seasonal VPD of around 0.5 kPa. Over 3years, the observed mean biomass at anthesis and grain yield ranged from 4200 to 10200kgha(-1) and 1600 to 3900kgha(-1), respectively, over various sowing times and irrigation regimes. The mean observed response to daytime eCO(2) (from 365 to 550molmol(-1) CO2) was relatively consistent for biomass at stem elongation and at anthesis and LAI at anthesis and grain yield with 21\%, 23\%, 21\% and 26\%, respectively. Seasonal water use was decreased from 320 to 301mm (P=0.10) by eCO(2), increasing water use efficiency for biomass and yield, 36\% and 31\%, respectively. The performance of six models (APSIM-Wheat, APSIM-Nwheat, CAT-Wheat, CROPSYST, OLEARY-CONNOR and SALUS) in simulating crop responses to eCO(2) was similar and within or close to the experimental error for accumulated biomass, yield and water use response, despite some variations in early growth and LAI. The primary mechanism of biomass accumulation via radiation use efficiency (RUE) or transpiration efficiency (TE) was not critical to define the overall response to eCO(2). However, under irrigation, the effect of late sowing on response to eCO(2) to biomass accumulation at DC65 was substantial in the observed data (similar to 40\%), but the simulated response was smaller, ranging from 17\% to 28\%. Simulated response from all six models under no water or nitrogen stress showed similar response to eCO(2) under irrigation, but the differences compared to the dryland treatment were small. Further experimental work on the interactive effects of eCO(2), water and temperature is required to resolve these model discrepancies.},

	abstract = {The prospect of climate change has revived both fears of food insecurity and its corollary, market opportunities for agricultural production. In Australia, with its long history of state-sponsored agricultural development, there is renewed interest in the agricultural development of tropical and sub-tropical northern regions. Climate projections suggest that there will be less water available to the main irrigation systems of the eastern central and southern regions of Australia, while net rainfall could be sustained or even increase in the northern areas. Hence, there could be more intensive use of northern agricultural areas, with the relocation of some production of economically important commodities such as vegetables, rice and cotton. The problem is that the expansion of cropping in northern Australia has been constrained by agronomic and economic considerations. The present paper examines the economics, at both farm and regional level, of relocating some cotton production from the east-central irrigation areas to the north where there is an existing irrigation scheme together with some industry and individual interest in such relocation. Integrated modelling and expert knowledge are used to examine this example of prospective climate change adaptation. Farm-level simulations show that without adaptation, overall gross margins will decrease under a combination of climate change and reduction in water availability. A dynamic regional Computable General Equilibrium model is used to explore two scenarios of relocating cotton production from south east Queensland, to sugar-dominated areas in northern Queensland. Overall, an increase in real economic output and real income was realized when some cotton production was relocated to sugar cane fallow land/new land. There were, however, large negative effects on regional economies where cotton production displaced sugar cane. It is concluded that even excluding the agronomic uncertainties, which are not examined here, there is unlikely to be significant market-driven relocation of cotton production.},

	abstract = {Global warming has lengthened the theoretical growing season of spring maize in Northeast China (NEC), and the temperatures during the growing season have increased. In practise, crop producers adjust sowing dates and alternate crop cultivars to take advantage of the lengthening growing season and increasing temperatures. In this study, we used crop data and daily weather data for 1981-2007 at five locations in NEC to quantify the utilization of the lengthening growing season and increasing temperatures by adjusting sowing dates and cultivar selection for spring maize production. If these two positive factors are not fully utilized, then it is important to know the potential impacts of these climatic trends on spring maize grain yields. The results show that in NEC, both the actual and theoretical growing seasons are lengthening, i.e., the sowing dates have been advanced and the maturity dates have been delayed. The actual sowing dates are 1-8 days later and the actual maturity dates are 6-22 days earlier than the theoretical perspective. Advancing sowing dates and changing cultivars led to 0-5 days and 6-26 days extension of the growing season. For the potential thermal time (TT), adjusting the sowing dates decreased the unutilized TT before sowing, while the cultivar selection increased the utilized TT and decreased the unutilized TT after maturity. On average, the unutilized heating resource before sowing is less than that after the maturity date (0.3-1.9\% vs. 2.1-7.8\%). During 1981-2007, for per day extension of the growing season, the spring maize grain yield increased by 75.2 kg ha(-1). The spring maize grain yields have increased by 7.1-57.2\% when both early sowing and changing cultivars during 1981-2007. In particular, adjusting the sowing dates increased the grain yield by 1.1-7.3\%, which was far less than the increase effect (6.5-43.7\%) from switching to late maturing cultivars. Therefore, selecting late maturing cultivars is an important technique to improve maize grain yields in NEC under the global warming context. Nevertheless, if the currently unutilized TT were fully explored, the local spring maize grain yield would have increased by 12.0-38.4\%. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Northeast China (NEC) is one of the most important agricultural production areas in China and is one of the most sensitive areas in the country to climate change, particularly during the last five decades when strong climate warming occurred. Thus, a better understanding of the potential, attainable, and farm yields and yield gaps of spring maize under climate change is necessary with respect to historical cultivars improvements. Ten spring maize cultivars commonly planted from the 1960s to the 2000s were selected for a two-year field experiment in Lishu, NEC. The APSIM-maize model was used to simulate the potential and attainable yields of spring maize from 1961 to 2009 using real-time cultivar calibration and validation during the past five decades. Our results indicated that the yield gap between the potential and farm yields was 9.7 t ha(-1), or 66.2\% of the potential yield; the yield gap between the attainable and farm yields was 5.6 t ha(-1), or approximately 54\% of the attainable yield. Climate change from 1961 to 2009 led to a reduction in the potential yield by 2.1\% and a reduction in the attainable yield by 8.0\%. Improved cultivars and agricultural practices have led to an increase of 62.2\% and 80.5\% in potential and attainable yields, respectively. Therefore, the combined impact of climate change and improvements in cultivars and agricultural practices increased potential and attainable yields 53.3\% and 70.3\%, respectively, for the period 1961-2009 relative to the yields of the cultivar planted in the 1960s. In conclusion, improvements in cultivars and agricultural practices for spring maize in NEC played a dominate role for the increase of yield, and the persistent large yield gap between farm and attainable or potential yields provides farmers an opportunity to increase their agricultural production.

	abstract = {This study set out to (1) calibrate and evaluate the performance of APSIM in simulating maize response to N, P and residue management and (2) identify strategies to reduce instability in crop production, and increase the efficiency of mineral fertilizer use. The response of maize to inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) additions were determined in the coastal savannah agro-ecology in the main rainy and secondary rainy seasons, of 2008 and 2009. Field experiments were set-up in a randomized complete block design with different levels of N (0-120 kg N ha(-1)) and P (0-30 kg P2O5 ha(-1)) mineral fertilizer. The APSIM model adequately simulated agroecosystem dynamics, resulting in the following RMSE values: anthesis (1.2 days), maturity (2.0 days), maximum LAI (0.18 m(2)m(-2)) total-biomass (543 kg ha(-1)), grain yield (318 kg ha(-1)), N uptake (12.6 kg ha(-1)), P uptake (2.2 kg ha(-1)) and in-season soil water content (0.01 mm). A long-term simulation study (30 years) showed that probabilities of obtaining higher yields were higher in the main growing season than in the secondary growing season. The efficiency of mineral N fertilizer use was also higher in the main growing season. The use of 40 kg N ha(-1) mineral N fertilizer in both seasons was more efficient than using 80 kg N ha(-1). The variability in the efficiency of mineral fertilizer use was higher in the secondary growing (44-96 \%) than in the main growing season (27-48 \%). Retaining crop residues yielded higher stability in grain production and increased the minimum grain yield production significantly. Applying 40 kg N ha(-1) and 30 kg P2O5 ha(-1) mineral fertilizer with crop residue retention will reduce the uncertainty in maize production, particularly in the secondary growing seasons which are characterized by prolonged drought spells. This study suggests that resource-poor farmers will be better off prioritizing the main growing season for rainfed maize production and applying a moderate amount (40 kg N ha(-1)) of N fertilizer rather than the 90 kg N ha(-1) currently recommended for the coastal savannah of Ghana in the secondary growing season because of the higher instability in yields associated with N fertilizer use in this season.},

	abstract = {One of the challenges to increase milk production in a large pasture-based herd with an automatic milking system (AMS) is to grow forages within a 1- km radius, as increases in walking distance increases milking interval and reduces yield. The main objective of this study was to explore sustainable forage option technologies that can supply high amount of grazeable forages for AMS herds using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model. Three different basic simulation scenarios (with irrigation) were carried out using forage crops (namely maize, soybean and sorghum) for the spring-summer period. Subsequent crops in the three scenarios were forage rape over-sown with ryegrass. Each individual simulation was run using actual climatic records for the period from 1900 to 2010. Simulated highest forage yields in maize, soybean and sorghum- (each followed by forage rape-ryegrass) based rotations were 28.2, 22.9, and 19.3 t dry matter/ha, respectively. The simulations suggested that the irrigation requirement could increase by up to 18\%, 16\%, and 17\% respectively in those rotations in years compared to neutral years. On the other hand, irrigation requirement could increase by up to 25\%, 23\%, and 32\% in maize, soybean and sorghum based rotations in El-Nino years compared to La-Nina years. However, irrigation requirement could decrease by up to 8\%, 7\%, and 13\% in maize, soybean and sorghum based rotations in La-Nina years compared to neutral years. The major implication of this study is that APSIM models have potentials in devising preferred forage options to maximise grazeable forage yield which may create the opportunity to grow more forage in small areas around the AMS which in turn will minimise walking distance and milking interval and thus increase milk production. Our analyses also suggest that simulation analysis may provide decision support during climatic uncertainty.},

	abstract = {The use of crop residues for bioenergy production needs to be carefully assessed because of the potential negative impact on the level of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. The impact varies with environmental conditions and crop management practices and needs to be considered when harvesting the residue for bioenergy productions. Here, we defined the sustainable harvest limits as the maximum rates that do not diminish SOC and quantified sustainable harvest limits for wheat residue across Australia's agricultural lands. We divided the study area into 9432 climate-soil (CS) units and simulated the dynamics of SOC in a continuous wheat cropping system over 122years (1889 - 2010) using the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM). We simulated management practices including six fertilization rates (0, 25, 50, 75, 100, and 200kg Nha(-1)) and five residue harvest rates (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100\%). We mapped the sustainable limits for each fertilization rate and assessed the effects of fertilization and three key environmental variables - initial SOC, temperature, and precipitation - on sustainable residue harvest rates. We found that, with up to 75kg Nha(-1) fertilization, up to 75\% and 50\% of crop residue could be sustainably harvested in south-western and south-eastern Australia, respectively. Higher fertilization rates achieved little further increase in sustainable residue harvest rates. Sustainable residue harvest rates were principally determined by climate and soil conditions, especially the initial SOC content and temperature. We conclude that environmental conditions and management practices should be considered to guide the harvest of crop residue for bioenergy production and thereby reduce greenhouse gas emissions during the life cycle of bioenergy production.},

We compared two process-based models (APSIM and NZ-DNDC) with measurements of N2O emissions, soil [GRAPHICS] and [GRAPHICS] content (0-75 mm) and water-filled pore space from a series of field campaigns where known amounts of animal urine-N were applied to four soil types under permanent pastures, in two regions within New Zealand, at different times of the year. We also compared cumulative N2O emissions with an N2O inventory emission factor approach (EF3 method). Overall, the two process-based models performed less well than the EF3 method for simulating cumulative N2O emissions over the complete data set. However, in winter, the APSIM model correlated well with measurements (r = 0.97), while NZ-DNDC performed well on the Otago soils (r = 0.83 and 0.92 for Wingatui and Otokia, respectively). The process-based models have the potential to account for the effect of weather conditions and soil type on N2O emissions that are not accounted for by the EF3 method. However, further improvements are currently needed. The fractions of N lost to different processes within the complex soil-plant atmosphere system differed between the two models. The size of the predicted plant uptake, [GRAPHICS] leaching and NH3 volatilisation fluxes are large compared with N2O emissions and could affect the simulated soil N pools and thus the predicted N2O fluxes. To simulate N2O fluxes accurately, it is therefore important to ensure these processes are well modelled and further validation studies are needed.},

	abstract = {This study used results from field experiments to calibrate the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model for 'Grasslands Kaituna' lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) crops grown in the cool temperate climate of New Zealand. The field data allowed refinement of functions related to the seasonality of crop phenology and above- and below-ground growth. The model structure was adequate to accommodate the calibration of reproductive development in response to temperature and photoperiod in both release and calibrated versions (root mean squared deviation [RMSD] from 14\% to 3\% of the mean, respectively). Similarly, vegetative development, characterised by the rate of appearance of main-stem nodes, was simulated with acceptable accuracy (RMSD from 28\% to 25\% of the mean). Analysis showed a lack of current field data to accurately represent the number of main-stem nodes at the beginning of each regrowth cycle, which is required to further improve the accuracy of leaf appearance simulations. The simulation of leaf area index (LAI) was slightly more accurate when using a site-specific empirical canopy modelling approach for 'Grassland Kaituna' (RMSD = 34\% of the mean) than with the more mechanistic approach in the release version used for Australian cultivars (RMSD = 40\% of the mean). This is particularly important before canopy closure, when LAI has the greatest influence on light interception and biomass accumulation. 'Grassland Kaituna' showed a seasonal pattern of change in leaf size and specific leaf area that could not be parameterised using the approach in the release version. Finally, the model structure of the calibrated version was adapted to explicitly simulate the seasonal flow of biomass to shoots and roots. For that, the 'shoot' radiation use efficiency (RUE) was modified to a 'whole plant' RUE of 1.6 g/MJ total solar radiation and a seasonal rate of below-ground biomass turnover (i.e. respiration plus senescence) was incorporated to correct for the initial offset observed between simulated and observed root biomass. These changes improved the RMSD from 53\% to 38\% for shoot biomass and 29\% to 18\% of the mean for roots. This calibration illustrates the heuristic aspect of applying crop models to identify knowledge gaps for guiding future experimentation, including time of node appearance on basal buds and leaf area index dynamics of contrasting lucerne cultivars.},

The GFWS platform can be used to assess the effects of annual crop productivity improvements on food production and incorporates data from 19 major food-producing nations to generate projections of food and water gaps in irrigated agriculture. Preliminary results indicate that crop-based food supply is able to meet food requirements by 2050, but this is only possible with 'input intensification' that includes increased rates of water in irrigated agriculture and fertiliser use per hectare and continued annual growth of crop yield productivity improvement of at least 0.5 \% per year over the period. Increased water withdrawals for agriculture with input intensification would, without any increases in withdrawals in the manufacturing, mining or household uses, place the world above the safe operating space in terms of overall water use by 2050. Even with input intensification, large and increasing crop-based food availability deficits to 2050 can be anticipated in some countries and regions within the group of 19 countries, especially in South Asia.},

	abstract = {There is debate over determining the appropriate model complexity to simulate crop development, growth, and yield. An approach that is sometimes suggested is to compare the performance of models using common datasets for ability to reproduce specific sets of observations. However, this narrow-focused approach overlooks the critical heuristic aspects in using models to explore and understand the behavior of cropping systems at the process level. We argue that the key criteria of model evaluation are both transparency and overall robustness. While model robustness (often mislabeled as "validation") is sometimes presented at some level, model transparency has normally been ignored in model comparison studies. The objective of this paper is to examine the transparency and robustness of four wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) models that are markedly different in detail; CropSyst and SSM as simpler models and APSIM and DSSAT as more complex models. Data for development, growth and yield of the crop were collected from a wide range of environmental and growth conditions in the Grogan region of Iran. Models parameterization was done according to the guidelines for each model and then model testing and comparison were performed using different datasets. The two simpler models were found to be more robust than the complex models; across all the evaluated crop variables, the coefficient of variation in yield prediction was lower for SSM (8.2\%) and CropSyst (14.3\%) than APSIM (15.0\%) and DSSAT (18.5\%). Transparency of the models was mainly gauged by the number of input parameters needed by the models. Simulations using APSIM (292 parameters) and DSSAT (211 parameters) required the definition of about fourfold more parameters than CropSyst (50 parameters) and SSM (55 parameters). The simulation results showed no significant relationship between model performance and parameter number; the lack of transparency sacrificed in complexity was not rewarded by increased robustness in the output.

This paper presents an evaluation of the APSIM-Oryza model for 15 Cambodian rice varieties under recommended practice.

	abstract = {Cereal residues represent a major resource for livestock feeding during the dry season in southern Africa. When kept on the soil surface instead of feeding them to livestock, crop residues can contribute to increasing soil fertility and maintaining crop productivity in the short- and the long-term. We explored these trade-offs for smallholder cotton-sorghum farming systems in the semi-arid Zambezi Valley, northern Zimbabwe. The analysis was done using simulation models at three scales, the plot, the farm and the territory, to simulate the effects of different sorghum residue allocations to livestock feeding vs. soil mulching, in combination with different application rates of mineral nitrogen fertilizer on crop productivity. The plot-scale simulations suggest that without N fertilization soil mulching has a positive effect on cotton yields only if small quantities of sorghum residues are used as mulch (average cotton yields of 2.24 +/- 0.41 kg ha(-1) with a mulch of 100 kg ha(-1) vs. 1.91 +/- 0.29 kg ha(-1) without mulch). Greater quantities of mulch have a negative effect on cotton yield without N fertilization due to N immobilization in the soil microbial biomass. With applications of 100 kg N ha(-1), quantities of mulch up to 3 t ha(-1) have no negative effect on cotton yield. Results at farm-scale highlight the fundamental role of livestock as a source of traction, and the need to feed a greater proportion of sorghum residues to livestock as herd and farm sizes increase. Farmers with no livestock attained maximum crop production when 100\% of their sorghum residue remained in the field, as they do not have access to cattle manure. The optimum fraction of crop residue to be retained in the fields for maximum farm crop production varied for farmers with 2 or less heads of cattle (80\% retention), with 2-3 heads (60-80\%), with 4 or more heads (40-60\%). At the scale of the entire territory, total cotton and sorghum production increased with the density of cattle, at the expense of soil mulching with crop residues. The results of our simulations suggest that (i) the optimum level of residue retention depends on the scale at which trade-offs are analyzed; (ii) the retention of all of the crop residue as mulch appears unrealistic and undesirable in farming systems that rely on livestock for traction; and (iii) crop residue mulching could be made more attractive to farmers by paying due attention to balancing C to N ratios in the soil and by promoting small-scale mechanization to replace animal traction.

Importantly, it was necessary to increase irrigation amounts by almost 50 \% to maintain adequate soil moisture levels.

However, these systems are not sustainable due to over-exploitation of the groundwater resource on which they largely rely. Current farmer practice (FP) involves manual transplanting of rice into heavily tilled/puddled soil from 10 June to early July, prolonged periods of flooding, rice residue burning, and heavy tillage prior to sowing wheat. Inclusion of a short duration mungbean crop between wheat harvest and rice transplanting has also been promoted at times. Options for reducing irrigation input to the RW system include delaying transplanting until after the monsoon rains start (late June), switching to shorter duration rice varieties, and alternate wetting drying (AWD) water management for rice. However, the effect of such practices on groundwater depletion is not well-understood. Examining the effects of these options on cropping system yield and components of the water balance and water productivity is highly complex because of the need to consider the interactions between each crop in the system. Therefore, we used a cropping system model (APSIM) to compare the performance of RW systems with a range of rice transplanting dates (4 dates from 10 June to 10 August) and rice variety durations (long - 158d, medium - 144d, short - 125 d), with and without mungbean in the system.

We analyze the performance of the point-scale crop model APSIM and the global scale crop model LPJmL with different climate and soil conditions under different agricultural management in the low-input maize-growing areas of Burkina Faso, West Africa. We test the models' response to different levels of input information from little to detailed information on soil, climate (1961-2000) and agricultural management and compare the models' ability to represent the observed spatial (between locations) and temporal variability (between years) in crop yields. We found that the resolution of different soil, climate and management information influences the simulated crop yields in both models. However, the difference between models is larger than between input data and larger between simulations with different climate and management information than between simulations with different soil information. The observed spatial variability can be represented well from both models even with little information on soils and management but APSIM simulates a higher variation between single locations than LPJmL. The agreement of simulated and observed temporal variability is lower due to non-climatic factors e.g. investment in agricultural research and development between 1987 and 1991 in Burkina Faso which resulted in a doubling of maize yields. The findings of our study highlight the importance of scale and model choice and show that the most detailed input data does not necessarily improve model performance.},

	abstract = {Extreme weather events (frost and heat shock), already a significant challenge for grain producers, are predicted to increase under future climate scenarios. This paper reviews the current knowledge on the impacts of extreme heat (heat shock) and frost on crop production and how these impacts are incorporated into contemporary process-based crop models. Heat shock and frost result in a range of physiological impacts on wheat. Based on the literature we conclude that the greatest impacts on production from frost are associated with sterility and the abortion of formed grains around anthesis. While the greatest yield impact from heat shock are reduced grain number (sterility and abortion of grains) during anthesis to early grain filling; as well as the reduced duration of grain filling. Crop models generally did not consider the non-linear response in grain yield from a heat shock or frost event due to these key physiological impacts. While frost damage was incorporated into a number of models through winterkill functions, seedling death or advanced senescence, only the STICS model incorporated a potential decrease in grain number around anthesis. In contrast, heat shock was rarely considered within crop models, with only two examples found in the literature; (1) APSIM-Nwheat which incorporated accelerated senescence in response to extreme heat and (2) MONICA which incorporated a reduction in grain number and yield. We propose a conceptual model for the change in grain number and therefore yield in response to both a frost and heat shock event. We discuss the potential use of daily maximum/minimum temperatures, canopy temperature and heat/frost loads for determining crop response in the models. As well as identifying the need for a greater understanding on how the duration of temperature extremes impact on yield, as well as the cumulative effects of multiple heat/frost events and the interactions with other abiotic stresses including drought.

	abstract = {Crop yields are influenced by growing season length, which are determined by temperature and agronomic management, such as sowing date and changes in cultivars. It is essential to quantify the interaction between climate change and crop management on crop phenology to understand the adaptation of farming systems to climate change. Historical changes in winter wheat phenology have been observed across the Loess Plateau of China during 1981-2009. The observed dates of sowing, emergence, and beginning of winter dormancy were delayed by an average of 1.2, 1.3, and 1.2 days decade(-1), respectively. Conversely, the dates of green-up (regrowth after winter dormancy), anthesis, and maturity advanced by an average of 2.0, 3.7, and 3.1 days decade(-1), respectively. Additionally, the growth duration (sowing to maturity), overwintering period, and vegetative phase (sowing to anthesis) shortened by an average of 4.3, 3.1, and 5.0 days decade(-1), respectively. The changes in phenological stages and phases were significantly negatively correlated with a temperature increase during this time. Differently to most other phase changes, the reproductive phase (anthesis to maturity) prolonged by an average of 0.7 day decade(-1), but this was spatially variable. The prolonged reproductive phase was due to advanced anthesis dates and consequently caused the reproductive phase to occur during a cooler part of the season, which led to an extended reproductive phase. Applying a crop simulation model using a field-tested standard cultivar across locations and years indicated that the simulated phenological stages have accelerated with the warming trend more than the observed phenological stages. This indicated that, over the last decades, later sowing dates and the introduction of new cultivars with longer thermal time requirement have compensated for some of the increased temperature-induced changes in wheat phenology.

	abstract = {Crop rotation, in which a legume, pasture, fallow or oilseed break crop' is grown after a cereal crop to manage soil-borne disease and weeds and, on occasions, to fix nitrogen, is one of the oldest techniques in agriculture. Valuing of crop rotations is complicated because the profitability of particular crop species changes with the prevalence of biotic stresses and varies with seasonal factors such as rainfall. With the Land Use Sequence Optimiser (LUSO) and the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) crop model, we generate an optimum land-use strategy for various biotic stresses and land-use options for a semi-arid grain-growing region in Australia. Over a 10-year time horizon, we compare the performance and variability of an optimal sequence with three sequences recommended by local agronomists. The agronomists recommended strategic sequences to manage weeds and disease and to maximise profit. The optimal crop sequence, with perfect knowledge, selected a mixture of grain legume, oilseed, cereal crops and pastures to manage biotic stresses and generate profit. This sequence precisely timed a period of exploitation, when high-profit crops were repeatedly grown and the biotic stresses increase, with a period of rehabilitation, when low-profit break crops are grown to reduce the biotic stresses. The agronomists' strategic sequences were either slightly more exploitative, grew more crops and allowed the biotic stresses to increase, or were more conservative and grew fewer profitable crops while managing the biotic stresses. Both strategic approaches were less profitable than the optimal crop sequence. The value of knowledge about a particular stress increases as its rate of accumulation in the farming system increases. With high levels of biotic weed stress, perfect knowledge was worth an additional AU\$73ha(-1) year(-1). In scenarios with lower levels of biotic weed stress, perfect knowledge was worth just \$24ha(-1) year(-1). Several measures of risk were defined, but there was no trade-off between profit and risk. Variability at the crop or enterprise scale did not necessarily translate into variability in profit when viewed over 10 years. Tools such as LUSO can help to determine the optimal crop sequence for a given series of enterprise options and a given level of biotic stress and explore the variability and risk associated with different enterprise choices.},

	volume = {31},
	abstract = {Agro-ecosystem, as the most active and controllable carbon pool in terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle, can lead to substantial changes in the atmospheric CO 2 concentration, thus affecting remarkably the global climate. The carbon cycle in agro-ecosystem is a complex process, which is influenced by factors such as climate, plants, soil properties and farm management. It is recognized that a model approach has an advantage in estimating spatiotemporal changes in carbon storage. Carbon cycle models are considered to be the most effective means to study carbon cycle. This paper emphasized on the carbon cycle process of agro-ecosystem, introduced the transference and the mechanism of carbon cycle between different carbon pools, identified characteristics of different models in association with carbon cycle of agro-ecosystem from 1960s, summarized and analyzed the application of international carbon models and others invented and developed in China in the agro-ecosystem. During these years, several models, such as RothC, CENTURY, DNDC, EPIC and APSIM have been widely used to estimate carbon changes at national or global scales. These models provide understanding of carbon flow through food webs and explore the role of carbon storage in the whole agro-ecosystem. They also allow analysis of environmental risks and provide a guide to know more about the relationship among carbon, nitrogen and water cycle. More recently, some new carbon models have been developed in China for simulating the carbon budget of agro-ecosystems. For example, the Agro-C can simulate crop net primary production via Crop-C sub model and changes in soil organic carbon via Soil-C sub model under various conditions of climate, soil, and agricultural practices, which makes it possible to extrapolate the model to a wider domain. Validation of the Soil-C sub model suggested that an inappropriate simplification of the carbon flow between various C pools may introduce errors into the estimates. Carbon loss in croplands was a very important issue for Chinese agro-ecosystems, and there was still a great potential for substantially improving carbon status by adopting proper farming practices and land-use pattern. This review has drawn together various perspectives on some of the key issues that should be addressed in order to keep more carbon and enhance soil productivity of croplands. In particular: (1) the mechanism of carbon cycle should be explored to model changes in carbon for the whole agro-ecosystem; (2) the study spatiotemporal changes of the carbon cycle should be investigated further; (3) the relationship among the nitrogen cycle, the water cycle, microbial and the carbon cycle should be made clear; (4) to use carbon cycle model to account for a range of different management practices and the redistribution of carbon; and (5) to investigate potential effects of different management practices on the carbon distribution for the government to formulate relevant policies.},

	abstract = {Research has been undertaken using the validated Agricultural Production System Simulator Model (APSIM) to explore the synergy effects of water and fertilizer supply on grain yields of crops under different tillage practices in the loess hilly region of Dingxi City, Gansu Province. The model was used to simulate yields of rotational systems of wheat ( Triticum aestivum) and pea ( Pisum sativum) under three different tillage practices: traditional tillage (T), no tillage (NT) and no tillage mulched with straw within 35 years (NTS). Multiple regression analysis was used to investigate the synergy effects of precipitation at the growing stage ( X3), fallow period ( X2) and when nitrogen was applied ( X1). Results showed that the order of relevance to grain yields was X3 {\textgreater} X2 {\textgreater} X1. For X3 and X2, the contribution rate differed in the order of NTS {\textgreater} NT {\textgreater} T. Nitrogen application has an oppositive U-shaped quadratic relation with wheat and pea yield. The optimum nitrogen quantities were 65.0, 65.5 and 44.5 kg/ha for spring wheat and 17.9, 18.5 and 23.8 kg/ha for peas under T, NT and NTS respectively. The contribution of nitrogen to the grain yields of each rotational system followed the order NTS {\textgreater} NT {\textgreater} T for spring wheat and NTS {\textgreater} NT {\textgreater} T for peas. Precipitation was therefore the key factor for the grain yields of spring wheat and pea in this region, especially in the case of NTS. Nitrogen application had different effects on yield under the three different tillage practices.},

The expansion of irrigation infrastructure in Tasmanian production systems with access to low-cost, plentiful irrigation sources will also influence these components in some areas. This paper reports on desktop modelling studies that aimed to benchmark wheat WUE and to explore the sensitivity of yield, water use and WUE to changes in management practice in a high-rainfall environment. Here, WUE was defined as: grain yield/(evapotranspiration+drainage+runoff). The crop simulation model APSIM-Wheat was used to quantify key water balance elements and estimate attainable' and potential' WUE and grain yield for 27 wheat trials. The upper limit for WUE was 30kg/ha.mm in excess of 180mm evaporation, which is 16\% higher than previous estimates at this southerly latitude for wheat. Attainable WUE ranged from 58\% to 100\% of potential WUE and was limited by nitrogen supply and water loss through evaporation, drainage and runoff. Model scenarios showed that co-limitation of inputs of nitrogen and irrigation was an important driver of grain yield and WUE. The implications of this research on crop management and production in temperate, high-rainfall environments are discussed.},

	abstract = {Rice ( Oryza sativa L.) production in Sri Lanka is heavily dependent on the rainfall distribution pattern of the cultivating season. Estimation of the variation in yield and resource use efficiency of commonly grown rice varieties will be of immense importance when predicting yields under variable and changing climate. In this context, a modelling approach was used to predict the yield and water productivity of commonly grown short and medium-duration rice varieties under different climate scenarios using APSIM-Oryza module, which was previously parameterised and tested with a strong model skill. Maha-Illuppallama (DL 1B) and Thabbowa (DL 3) in the Dry zone of Sri Lanka were selected as the study areas. Daily rainfall data for the past 35 years (1976-2011) were analysed and the normal onset time period of Maha rains was identified in terms of a two-week period for each year, separately. The onset of rain before and after the identified weeks was considered as an early or late onset, respectively. Yield of rice varieties Bg300 (short duration; 3 months age class) and Bg359 (medium duration; 3.5 months age class) was simulated under the rainfed condition. The yield of rice varieties BG300 and Bg359 and the irrigation water requirement were simulated under two scenarios namely, (1) Normal Rainfall Distribution (NRD), and (2) Intense Rainfall Distribution (IRD). The results revealed that the amount of rainfall received during the Maha season was higher when an early onset occurred (63\% to 94\%) than that observed with a late onset. Rainy season ceased by late February at both locations irrespective of the time of onset of rainfall. The simulated yield of Bg359 under the two scenarios tested (i.e. NRD and IRD) were similar. However, delayed onset would increase the irrigation water requirement by 10-17\%. Furthermore, a yield advantage of 14-51\% under IRD was observed only during an early onset compared to the NRD. The results also revealed that under the IRD condition, the variability of rice yield of Bg300 was lesser irrespective of the onset compared to that of Bg359 indicating that a climate forecast for IRD during the Maha season would assist farmers to opt for short duration rice varieties compared to medium duration varieties due to lower estimated yield losses in the former.},

	abstract = {Canola (Brassica napus L.) has recently been adopted as a dual-purpose crop (graze and grain) in the higher rainfall areas ({\textgreater} 550 mm) of eastern Australia, but the feasibility in drier inland areas with a shorter growing season is uncertain. We modified the APSIM-Canola model by using observations from an irrigated grazing experiment, with the aim of using a simulation approach to investigate various aspects of dual-purpose canola production. Sowing opportunities, forage production for grazing and grain production were considered in the simulations, and effects of variables such as sowing date, cultivar type, plant density and nitrogen supply were investigated in simulations for 109 years of climate data from Wagga Wagga, NSW. APSIM-Canola predictions of vegetative growth and grain yield for recent varieties were inadequate when using existing parameters, but were improved by increasing the maximum leaf area parameter to reflect those of modern hybrid types. For grazed crops, APSIM-Canola overestimated the initial rate of regrowth, but accurately simulated biomass at flowering. Simulations of a range of management options to generate different pre-grazing biomass predicted that sowing before 15 May, using vigorous (hybrid) cultivars, high plant density (60-80 plants m(-2)) and adequate soil nitrogen, maximised biomass production. Assuming a rainfall-based sowing opportunity of 25 mm over 3 days and a minimum pre-grazing biomass of 1000 kg ha(-1), grazing was possible in 53\% of years, with 50\% of those years providing grazing opportunities before 7 June at Wagga Wagga. Depending on stocking rate, crops could be grazed until early to mid-July, providing 400-1000 dry sheep equivalent days ha-1 of grazing, and allow regrowth to achieve a target biomass of 5000 kg ha(-1) at flowering, which was required to maximise potential yield. The simulation analysis confirms significant opportunities to achieve valuable livestock grazing from canola crops sown in an early window (before May) without compromising potential yield, and the simulation framework developed can be readily applied to other regions.},

	abstract = {Recent expansion of cropping into Australia's high-rainfall zone (HRZ) has involved dual-purpose crops suited to long growing seasons that produce both forage and grain. Early adoption of dual-purpose cropping involved cereals; however, dual-purpose canola (Brassica napus) can provide grazing and grain and a break crop for cereals and grass-based pastures. Grain yield and grazing potential of canola (up until bud-visible stage) were simulated, using APSIM, for four canola cultivars at 13 locations across Australia's HRZ over 50 years. The influence of sowing date (2-weekly sowing dates from early March to late June), nitrogen (N) availability at sowing (50, 150 and 250 kg N/ha), and crop density (20, 40, 60, 80 plants/m(2)) on forage and grain production was explored in a factorial combination with the four canola cultivars. The cultivars represented winter, winter x spring intermediate, slow spring, and fast spring cultivars, which differed in response to vernalisation and photoperiod. Overall, there was significant potential for dual-purpose use of winter and winter x spring cultivars in all regions across Australia's HRZ. Mean simulated potential yields exceeded 4.0 t/ha at most locations, with highest mean simulated grain yields (4.5-5.0 t/ha) in southern Victoria and lower yields (3.3-4.0 t/ha) in central and northern New South Wales. Winter cultivars sown early (March-mid-April) provided most forage ({\textgreater}2000 dry sheep equivalent (DSE) grazing days/ha) at most locations because of the extended vegetative stage linked to the high vernalisation requirement. At locations with Mediterranean climates, the low frequency ({\textless}30\% of years) of early sowing opportunities before mid-April limited the utility of winter cultivars. Winter x spring cultivars (not yet commercially available), which have an intermediate phenology, had a longer, more reliable sowing window, high grazing potential (up to 1800 DSE-days/ha) and high grain-yield potential. Spring cultivars provided less, but had commercially useful grazing opportunities (300-700 DSE-days/ha) and similar yields to early-sown cultivars. Significant unrealised potential for dual-purpose canola crops of winter x spring and slow spring cultivars was suggested in the south-west of Western Australia, on the Northern Tablelands and Slopes of New South Wales and in southern Queensland. The simulations emphasised the importance of early sowing, adequate N supply and sowing density to maximise grazing potential from dual-purpose crops.},

	abstract = {Shifts in rainfall and rising temperatures due to climate change pose a formidable challenge to the sustainability of broadacre crop yields in Western and South-Eastern Australia. Output from18 Global Climate Models (GCMs) for the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A2 scenario was statistically downscaled to four contrasting locations. For the first time in these regions, bias corrected statistically downscaled climate data were employed to drive the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) crop model that integrates the effects of soil, crop phenotype, and management options for a quantitative comparison of crop yields and phenology under an historical and a plausible projected climate. The dynamic APSIM simulation model explore the implications of climate change across multiple locations and multiple time periods (1961-2010,2030, 2060 and 2090) for multiple key crops (wheat, barley, lupin, canola, field pea) grown in three different types of soil. On average, the ensemble of downscaled GCM projections show a decrease in rainfall in the future at the four locations considered, with increased variability at two locations. At all locations and for five crops, future changes in both crop biomass and grain yield are strongly associated with changes in rainfall (P = 0.05 to P = 0.001). The overall rainfall amount is critical in determining yields but, equally, higher future temperatures can contribute to reducing crop productivity primarily due to advanced crop phenology. For example, for wheat cropping at Hamilton (a higher rainfall site), there is a significant advancement in median flowering date for 2030, 2060, and 2090 of 10, 18, and 29 days respectively with a significant 0.50\% grain yield changes for each percentage change in rainfall compared to significant 0.90\% grain yield changes in Cunderdin (a lower rainfall site). At all sites except Hamilton, the change in crop grain yield is significantly correlated (P = 0.001) with the percentage change in the future rainfall and the impact increased progressively from higher rainfall to lower rainfall sites. However, the magnitude of the change in crop phenology and yield were not significantly different between soil types. These results help to define regions of concern and their relative importance in the coming years. In this future climate the negative consequences for crop yields and advancement of phenology relative to baseline are not uniform across crops and locations. Of the crops studied - wheat, barley, lupin, canola and field pea - field pea is the most sensitive to the projected future climate changes, and the ensemble median changes in field pea yield range from a decrease of 12\% to a decrease of 45\%, depending on location. These results highlight the importance of research and policy to support strategies for adapting to climate change, such as advances in agronomy, soil moisture conservation, seasonal climate forecasting and breeding new crop varieties.

	abstract = {The impact of climate change on maize potential productivity and the potential productivity gap in Southwest China (SWC) are investigated in this paper. We analyze the impact of climate change on the photosynthetic, light-temperature, and climatic potential productivity of maize and their gaps in SWC, by using a crop growth dynamics statistical method. During the maize growing season from 1961 to 2010, minimum temperature increased by 0.20A degrees C per decade (p {\textless} 0.01) across SWC. The largest increases in average and minimum temperatures were observed mostly in areas of Yunnan Province. Growing season average sunshine hours decreased by 0.2 h day(-1) per decade (p {\textless} 0.01) and total precipitation showed an insignificant decreasing trend across SWC. Photosynthetic potential productivity decreased by 298 kg ha-1 per decade (p {\textless} 0.05). Both light-temperature and climatic potential productivity decreased (p {\textless} 0.05) in the northeast of SWC, whereas they increased (p {\textless} 0.05) in the southwest of SWC. The gap between light-temperature and climatic potential productivity varied from 12 to 2729 kg ha(-1), with the high value areas centered in northern and southwestern SWC. Climatic productivity of these areas reached only 10\%-24\% of the light-temperature potential productivity, suggesting that there is great potential to increase the maize potential yield by improving water management in these areas. In particular, the gap has become larger in the most recent 10 years. Sensitivity analysis shows that the climatic potential productivity of maize is most sensitive to changes in temperature in SWC. The findings of this study are helpful for quantification of irrigation water requirements so as to achieve maximum yield potentials in SWC.},

	abstract = {Complex crop growth models (CGM) require a large number of input parameters, which can cause large errors if they are uncertain. Furthermore, they often lack spatial information. The coupling of a CGM with a radiative transfer model offers the possibility to assimilate remote sensing data while taking into account uncertainties in input parameters. A particle filter was used to assimilate satellite data into a CGM coupled with a leaf-canopy radiative transfer model to update biomass simulations of maize. The synthetic experiment set up to test the reliability of the procedure, highlighted the importance of the acquisition time. The real case study with RapidEye observations confirmed these findings. Data assimilation increased the accuracy of biomass predictions in the majority of the six maize fields where biomass validation data was available, with improvements of up to 15\%. The smallest and largest errors in biomass prediction after assimilation were 82 kg/ha and 2116 kg/ha, respectively. Furthermore, data assimilation enabled the production of biomass maps showing detailed spatial variability. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the arid and semi-arid environments where the rainfall is limited and variable, fallow period soil moisture conservation using stubble is one of the ways of increasing the soil moisture required for crop sowing and development. However, the effectiveness of moisture conservation using stubble depends on the paddock management, soil water content, and rainfall characteristics. To assess the effect of stubble rate and amount of rainfall on the soil moisture conservation, a two-season field experiment was conducted using four stubble rates (0, 2, 4, 6 t/ha) and two water supply amounts. The soil water dynamics was also analysed using a validated Agricultural Production System Simulator (APSIM). In the relatively wet summer season with a high initial soil water content, the amount of water stored in the 2, 4, and 6 t/ha stubble rate treatment plots was higher than that of the bare plots by 10.4, 15.9, and 17.8 mm, respectively. However, in the summer season with a relatively high amount of in-season water input and low initial soil water content, the soil water storage was increased by 29.4, 35.6, and 43.0 mm, respectively. Comparing the results of the two seasons, the highest increase was observed for the 2 t/ha stubble rate. The amount of conserved soil moisture was found to be the highest when the soil profile water content at the start of the summer-fallow period is low and the amount of rain during the summer season is high. The good agreement between the measured and APSIM-simulated soil water contents (R-2 = 0.812), indicates that the model can be used to assess the soil water dynamics under a fallow condition. The APSIM-simulated soil water balance using the weather data of the past 100 years indicated that in a year with low start-of-fallow period soil water content, a 6 t/ha stubble rate can increase the end-of-fallow period soil moisture by up to 60 \%.},

	abstract = {If the land sector is to make significant contributions to mitigating anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in coming decades, it must do so while concurrently expanding production of food and fiber. In our view, mathematical modeling will be required to provide scientific guidance to meet this challenge. In order to be useful in GHG mitigation policy measures, models must simultaneously meet scientific, software engineering, and human capacity requirements. They can be used to understand GHG fluxes, to evaluate proposed GHG mitigation actions, and to predict and monitor the effects of specific actions; the latter applications require a change in mindset that has parallels with the shift from research modeling to decision support. We compare and contrast 6 agro-ecosystem models (FullCAM, DayCent, DNDC, APSIM, WNMM, and AgMod), chosen because they are used in Australian agriculture and forestry. Underlying structural similarities in the representations of carbon flows though plants and soils in these models are complemented by a diverse range of emphases and approaches to the subprocesses within the agro-ecosystem. None of these agro-ecosystem models handles all land sector GHG fluxes, and considerable model-based uncertainty exists for soil C fluxes and enteric methane emissions. The models also show diverse approaches to the initialisation of model simulations, software implementation, distribution, licensing, and software quality assurance; each of these will differentially affect their usefulness for policy-driven GHG mitigation prediction and monitoring. Specific requirements imposed on the use of models by Australian mitigation policy settings are discussed, and areas for further scientific development of agro-ecosystem models for use in GHG mitigation policy are proposed.

	abstract = {West Africa is highly vulnerable to climate hazards and better quantification and understanding of the impact of climate change on crop yields are urgently needed. Here we provide an assessment of near-term climate change impacts on sorghum yields in West Africa and account for uncertainties both in future climate scenarios and in crop models. Towards this goal, we use simulations of nine bias-corrected CMIP5 climate models and two crop models (SARRA-H and APSIM) to evaluate the robustness of projected crop yield impacts in this area. In broad agreement with the full CMIP5 ensemble, our subset of bias-corrected climate models projects a mean warming of +2.8 degrees C in the decades of 2031-2060 compared to a baseline of 1961-1990 and a robust change in rainfall in West Africa with less rain in the Western part of the Sahel (Senegal, South-West Mali) and more rain in Central Sahel (Burkina Faso, South-West Niger). Projected rainfall deficits are concentrated in early monsoon season in the Western part of the Sahel while positive rainfall changes are found in late monsoon season all over the Sahel, suggesting a shift in the seasonality of the monsoon. In response to such climate change, but without accounting for direct crop responses to CO2, mean crop yield decreases by about 16-20\% and year-to-year variability increases in the Western part of the Sahel, while the eastern domain sees much milder impacts. Such differences in climate and impacts projections between the Western and Eastern parts of the Sahel are highly consistent across the climate and crop models used in this study. We investigate the robustness of impacts for different choices of cultivars, nutrient treatments, and crop responses to CO2. Adverse impacts on mean yield and yield variability are lowest for modern cultivars, as their short and nearly fixed growth cycle appears to be more resilient to the seasonality shift of the monsoon, thus suggesting shorter season varieties could be considered a potential adaptation to ongoing climate changes. Easing nitrogen stress via increasing fertilizer inputs would increase absolute yields, but also make the crops more responsive to climate stresses, thus enhancing the negative impacts of climate change in a relative sense. Finally, CO2 fertilization would significantly offset the negative climate impacts on sorghum yields by about 10\%, with drier regions experiencing the largest benefits, though the net impacts of climate change remain negative even after accounting for CO2.},

Evaluating the effect of all these factors, and their combination, through field experimentation is not always feasible.

The APSIM program is one of such models which are widely used to simulate crop yield and resource-use under different scenarios. In this study, the APSIM-CANOLA module, with long-term climate records, was used to examine the effects of seasonal variability, sowing date and plant available water at sowing on grain yield of several canola cultivars. There was high year to year variability of simulated crop yield in response to the amount of rain. Water use efficiency was found to be cultivar dependent. Sowing date affects the length of crop growing season and hence crop yield. Higher starting soil water significantly contributes to crop production. Break-even canola grain yields were attainable with high probability but higher yields were increasingly less probable and unattainable with some cultivars and under certain sowing and rainfall conditions.

	abstract = {Cotton is the main cultivated cash crop in Northwest China. This study is motivated by the challenge of economically growing cotton in the face of climate change, which could lead to changes in cotton variety, phenology, water demand, heat requirement and yield. The APSIM-OzCot crop growth model is used to simulate cotton cultivation at two sites with different climatic conditions (Shihezi and Alaer, Xinjiang Province). The model is fully calibrated and validated using observations. Simulations forced with future climate data downscaled from the HadCM3 Global Climate Model show that the response of cotton phenology, yield and water use to climate change is different for different cultivation, sites, greenhouse gas emission scenarios and time horizons. Under the SRES A1B and B1 emissions scenarios, cotton yield and water use are greater in the future than in the 1961-1990 period while the growing season is shorter. Under the SRES A2 emissions scenario, however, yields at cold sites drop after 2070 due mainly to the shortening of cotton growth periods. Thus, in the cold regions, varieties with short growth periods are replaced by those with long growth periods. The results show that, compared with current local varieties, cotton yields increase by 356 kg/ha with the medium maturity variety "K7" and 473 kg/ha with the late maturity variety "ZM49" under the A2 scenario by 2070. Total evapotranspiration correspondingly increases by 69 mm ("K7") and 92 mm ("ZM49"). However, water use efficiency increases by 0.32 kg/m(3) to 0.34 kg/m(3) (6.3\%) and 0.35 kg/m(3) (9.4\%) for "K7" and "ZM49", respectively. A reasonable adaptive strategy to maintain cotton yields in the future may be to decrease the area over which cotton is planted and raise water use efficiency. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Here we combine simulation modeling and long-term maize yield records (1981-2009) from 10 sites to investigate the changes in maize yield potential, actual yield and yield gaps in the past three decades in the North China Plain (NCP). The cultivar parameters in the APSIM-maize model were derived based on the recorded flowering and maturity dates at each site, and the simulation results of calibrated model was able to explain {\textgreater}63\% of the variations in recorded maize grain yield across the 10 sites. Potential maize yield simulated under sufficient water and nitrogen supply showed a general declining trend, significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) at half of the study sites. This was mainly caused by the declining radiation together with increasing temperature, particularly during the pre-flowering period. Continuous adoptions of new maize varieties helped to maintain the pre-flowering periods at some sites and to extend post-flowering periods at most sites. This, together with increasing planting density, led to continuous increase in maize yields. As a result, maize yield gaps continued to shrink (P {\textless} 0.05) at all the sites except for Zhengzhou, with a rate ranging from -116.8 kg/ha a to -356.5 kg/ha a across sites. At two of the studied sites, the maize potential yield had already been achieved. While application of irrigation and nitrogen fertilizers has been managed at near optimal level already, other new technological breakthroughs will be needed for future advance of maize yield.

A total of 37 paddocks in north-western Victoria, Australia, were sampled during 2003-2006 for AGB at anthesis, and for FGrC, NDVI (from an active optical sensor), and AGB during 2012. The 2012 FGrC and NDVI measurements were fitted to MODIS NDVI, resulting in positive, linear relationships when the MODIS NDVI values were {\textless}= 0.80. Measured AGB was also positively, linearly related to MODIS summed NDVI, resulting in an overall R-2 of 0.81 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 1397 kg/ha. Crop simulations were run for the fourteen paddocks from 2003 to 2006, and six paddocks from 2012. Four crop phenological points were selected to extract corresponding NDVI and simulated crop parameters: emergence, peak LAI, the mid-point between emergence and peak LAI, and anthesis. Linear models were fit between the MODIS NDVI and simulated values of FGrC, LAI, and AGB. Overall, the highest values corresponded to using all of the dates for FGrC (R-2 = 0.82) and AGB (R-2 = 0.92), and anthesis dates for LAI (R-2 = 0.74). For FGrC and AGB, the RMSE with simulated parameters were comparable or better than the equivalent results from the in situ measurements (note that there were no LAI in situ measurements to compare with). The results support the notion for extending the value of the MODIS NDVI using crop simulation models. The combination of remotely sensed and simulation data might offer regional maps of spatial AGB and ultimately grain yield, which would have high value for research, resource management, policy, and potentially, crop management.},

	abstract = {The yield gap (YG) between the potential yields (Yp) and the average on-farm yields (Ya) is an indicator of the potential improvement for crop production. Understanding how large the current gap is and how this gap has changed over the past few decades is essential for increasing wheat production to meet increased food demand in China. This paper describes a study conducted using an APSIM-Wheat model and farm-level crop yield to analyze the spatio-temporal distribution of the yield gap of winter wheat from 1981 to 2010 in the North China Plain. Nine varieties were calibrated and evaluated based on the data from 16 agro-meteorological experimental sites and then potential yields were estimated considering cultivar replacement. In addition, a trend pattern analysis of on-farm yields for the period 1981-2010 was conducted. Results revealed an estimated yield gap across the entire North China Plain region of 1140-6810 kg ha(-1), with a weight average of 3630 kg ha(-1) in 1981-2010. Expressed as a relative yield (yield gap \% of potential yields), the range was 15-80\%, and the weight average was 45\%. Despite the negative effects of increasing temperature and decreasing radiation, the potential yields significantly increased by 45 kg ha-1 per year due to cultivar improvement. On-farm yields increased even more notably because of new cultivar selection, increased fertilizer application and other management improvements, but were stagnating in 32.3\% of wheat areas, located mainly in Hebei province, Shandong province, Beijing and Tianjin. The improvement of on-farm yields have substantially contributed to yield gap spatio-temporal variation. As a result, the yield gap decreased from 4200 kg ha(-1) (56\%) in 1981-1990 to 3000 kg ha(-1) (35\%) in 2001-2010 at a rate of 69 kg ha(-1) per year. However, yields stagnation will expand to the northern Henan province without cultivar potential productivity improving, where yield gap was close to or less than 20\% of the potential yields and proved difficult to reduce. To further improve the total production of winter wheat in the coming decades, efforts should be paid to break the potential ceiling and reduce the yield gap by breeding higher yield variety and introduction of new agricultural technology.

	abstract = {Accurate modelling of root biomass and root distribution of crop plants has become increasingly important in order to address issues related to carbon sequestration in soil and resource use efficiency of crops under different environmental and management conditions. However, the performance of crop models for simulating crop root system has been rarely tested in many environments due to lack of detailed data on roots. In this paper, we present detailed measurement data on root biomass and distribution in 0-200 cm soil profile at key developmental stages of wheat crop at Wuqiao in the North China Plain, and compare them with the root dynamics simulated by the agricultural systems model APSIM. The objectives are to test the model performance for simulating root biomass and distribution, and to investigate the potential impact of errors in root modelling on simulated wheat yield and soil carbon change. Compared to the measurements at the study site, APSIM version 7.5 underestimated the rooting front advance and final rooting depth of winter wheat, but overestimated the root biomass and root-shoot ratio at maturity by 100-200\%. Modifications to root growth parameters in the model led to improved simulations of root depth and biomass dynamics. The modifications had little impact on simulated shoot biomass and grain yield under conditions of sufficient nitrogen supply, but led to higher simulated grain yield when nitrogen was deficient. They also resulted in reduction in simulated soil organic carbon in the top (0-20 cm) soil layer by 0.02\%. A meta-analysis combining wheat root and shoot data from literature indicated that the APSIM model simulated a much tighter root-shoot relationship than that observed in the data, and that both versions of the model simulated the root-shoot relationships within the measured range. The relationship simulated from the original model better matched the data points from dry climate and dryland conditions. While the modified model based on Wuqiao data simulated a relationship better matching the data points from wet climate and irrigated conditions. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The northern grains region (NGR) of Australia, which includes the state of Queensland and the northern half of the New South Wales, has highly variable climate leading to heightened production risk for all rainfed crops. Characterisation of the production environment of this region can assist in exploration of potential opportunities for reducing this risk. In this case study on mungbean (Vigna radiata L Wilczek.) we demonstrate how this region could be characterised using the Agricultural Production Systems sIM-ulator (APSIM) model. The model was first evaluated for variety Crystal grown widely in the region, and then applied to simulate a water stress index (the daily supply and demand ratio) and yield from 1889 to 2012 at 28 locations. The model was run using location specific as well as three generic soils of 136, 166 and 204 mm plant available water holding capacities (PAWC). Two complementary characterisations were performed using the simulated output, one based on clustering of supply demand ratio averaged for every 100 degrees Cd to and from flowering, and another on clustering of percentile rankings of seasonal yield variation at different locations. Clustering of supply demand ratio revealed four drought patterns (i.e., target production environments) which commenced at different times from flowering. Seasonal frequencies of these drought patterns, which differed due to major location effects and relatively smaller soil effects, accounted for significant (similar to 84\%) variation in simulated yield. Clustering of percentile ranks corresponding to simulated yield in different seasons identified seven meaningful yield clusters. Location memberships of these yield clusters were geographically contiguous and were only slightly influenced for the lowest PAWC generic soil. All locations within these yield clusters showed a tendency to have similar seasonal drought patterns and their frequencies. Locations within different yield clusters could therefore be considered as part of distinct agro-ecoregions. These model defined agro-ecoregions could be used as selection environments for their dominant target production environment(s) to develop new genotypes and their agronomy for better adaptation and yield under variable climatic conditions.

	abstract = {The concept of critical nitrogen (N) concentration (Ncc) has been used for both diagnostic purposes and modelling of wheat-N relations. Ncc has been derived with two contrasting approaches: one against above ground biomass (Ncc-biomass), and one against developmental stages (Ncc-stage). While the former has been claimed in diagnostic use, both approaches are adopted in wheat simulation models. This paper provides data from North China Plain (NCP) to re-exam the Ncc-stage relationships used in two widely used wheat models (APSIM and CERES) and to compare the Ncc-biomass vs. Ncc-stage relationships. The results revealed significant higher maximum and critical N concentrations in leaves of wheat in NCP than the values used in the APSIM-wheat model. Recalibration of the APSIM model with the new N concentrations led to improved simulations for wheat biomass and N uptake, particularly under low N input. Our results also show that the Ncc-stage relationship appeared to be more robust than the Ncc-biomass relationship, and it helped explain the variations in wheat Ncc-biomass curves from different regions. This likely reflects the fact that Ncc-stage curve captures the stage-driven formation of structural biomass and carbohydrate reserves of wheat, which is the main cause for N dilution. The implications of the findings on modelling of wheat-nitrogen relationships and on nitrogen management practices are also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Soil has been identified as a possible carbon (C) sink for sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). However, soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics in agro-ecosystems is affected by complex interactions of various factors including climate, soil and agricultural management practices, which hinders our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. The objectives of this study were to use the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model to simulate the long-term SOC dynamics under different management practices at four long-term experimental sites, Zhengzhou and Xuzhou with double cropping systems and Gongzhuling and Urumqi with single cropping systems, located in northern China. Firstly, the model was calibrated using information from the sites and literature, and its performance to predict crop growth and SOC dynamics was examined The calibrated model was then used to assess the impacts of different management practices, including fertilizer application, irrigation, and residue retention, on C dynamics in the top 30 cm of the soil by scenario modelling. Results indicate a significant SOC sequestration potential through improved management practices of nitrogen (N) fertilizer application, stubble retention, and irrigation. Optimal N fertilization (N-opt) and 100\% stubble retention (R100) increased SOC by about 11.2\%, 208.29\%, and 283.67\% under irrigation at Gongzhuling, Zhengzhou, and Xuzhou, respectively. Soil organic carbon decreased rapidly at Urumqi under irrigation, which was due to the enhanced decomposition by increased soil moisture. Under rainfed condition, SOC remained at a higher level. The combination of Nopt and R100 increased SOC by about 0.46\% under rainfed condition at Urumqi. Generally, agricultural soils with double cropping systems (Zhengzhou and Xuzhou) showed a greater potential to sequester C than those with single cropping systems (Gongzhuling and Urumqi).},

	doi = {10.1016/j.agsy.2014.06.001},
	abstract = {The question addressed in this paper is whether the agronomic efficiency of cropping sequences can be improved in the northern grain zone of Australia. Analysis of whole systems over multiple seasons is particularly important in cropping regions such as Australia's northern grain zone, where farmers have the option of growing a variety of winter and summer crops and where fallowing is required to store water to safeguard yields of following crops. The study is based on a detailed longitudinal survey of the inputs and yields of 94 farmers' fields over 7 seasons. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) was used to benchmark the 94 cropping sequences and to determine if the productivity of these cropping sequences can be improved through changed management, particularly of nitrogen nutrition and timely sowing of individual crops. Comparison of surveyed and simulated yields were then used to determine the yield gap that can be explained by factors unaccounted for in APSIM, i.e. biotic stresses such as weeds, pests and diseases or inadequate operational management. Using a generalised N response curve, data from the simulation analysis were plotted relative to a normalised input output relationship to determine their position relative to an efficiency frontier representing the simulated production function. This analysis was conducted separately for both individual crops and for whole sequences in individual fields. The analysis of 193 individual crops showed that the average yield of 1.90 t/ha was 65\% of the simulated water and nitrogen-limited yield potential of 2.92 t/ha. Investigation of nitrogen unlimited and early sowing management options revealed that there was relatively little yield advantage (0.15 t/ha) to be gained from these management improvements. The remaining gap between observed yields and what the simulations suggest may be attributed to factors such as weeds, pests and diseases, sub-optimal operations or extreme weather events. Three production criteria were used to compare cropping sequences: (1) dollar income, (2) metabolisable energy yield, and (3) crude protein yields. While the income from 36\% of the individual crops in the study was found to be more than 80\% of their production frontier values, only 29\% of whole cropping sequences achieved this benchmark. Similar results were achieved when crops and crop sequences were evaluated in terms of their metabolisable energy and crude protein yields. It is concluded that in order to increase the agronomic efficiency of cropping in Australia's northern grain zone, attention should be focussed on the intensity and configuration of cropping sequences and on the management of fallows in addition to the management of individual crops.

	abstract = {The concept of ecosystem services (ESS) is widely used to highlight the interdependencies between agricultural and environmental systems. However, few studies have attempted to quantify the potential of agriculture to produce multiple ESS, and to estimate the possibilities for joint production of marketed and non-marketed ESS. A quantification of the trade-offs between non-marketed ESS and production of farm commodities (marketed ESS) may help to better target agricultural policies. We use a well-established biophysical farm-systems model (APSIM) to estimate how alternative farm management practices affect the joint production of ESS on mixed crop-livestock farms in the wheatbelt of Western Australia. Our analysis quantifies the trade-offs between the supply of agricultural commodities (crop yields and livestock weight gain) and non-marketed ESS (groundcover, soil carbon, nitrogen supply, and water regulation). Win-win trade-offs between marketed and non-marketed ESS become apparent when the value of agricultural commodity production is monetised. This study shows that, in our study regions, increasing crop residue retention can jointly increase production value and improve ESS provision of groundcover, soil carbon and nitrogen supply. Conversely, increasing the use of perennial pastures in the farming mix results in negative trade-offs between production values and non-marketed ESS. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The presence of a trash blanket affects sugarcane crops, by conservation of soil moisture and a potential to increase soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). To gain insights into the impacts of the burnt-to-green cane trash blanket transition, a simulation study was conducted with the APSIM-Sugar crop model. Simulations were conducted over 100 years for 3 locations: Piracicaba-SP, Palmas-TO, and Macei-AL, addressing 2 research questions: (1) what is the yield impact of the transition from burnt to GCTB due to soil N, C and water changes; and (2) what is the impact of trash removal on yield in fields managed under GCTBs. Both questions were answered based on the same set of simulations. We simulated the transition to GCTB after 25 years of burnt management combining four N rates and 3 trash removal treatments [no trash removal, 50 \% trash removal (50 \%) and 90 \% trash removal (90 \%)].

	abstract = {Process-based crop models use many cultivar parameters to simulate crop growth. Usually, these parameters cannot be directly measured and need to be calibrated when the crop model is applied to a new environment or a new cultivar. Determining the relative importance of the cultivar parameters to the specific outputs could streamline the calibration of crop models for new cultivars. Sensitivity analysis can quantify the influence of model input parameters on model outputs. We applied the variance-based global sensitivity analysis to the wheat module of the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) for the first time and calculated the sensitivity of four outputs including yield, biomass, flowering day, and maturity day to ten cultivar parameters including both the main and total effects sensitivity indices. We explored the effects of changing climate, soil, and management practices on parameter sensitivity by analyzing two fertilization rates (0 and 100 kg N ha(-1)), across five sites in Australia's cereal-growing regions. Uncertainties for the four outputs with varying cultivar parameters, climate-soil conditions and management practices were evaluated. We found that yield was most sensitive to the cultivar parameters that determine the yield component (grains per gram stem, max grain size, and potential grain filling rate) and the phenology parameters that determine length of the reproductive stages (thermal time from floral initiation to flowing and thermal time from start grain filling to maturity). All ten cultivar parameters affected biomass, amongst which the parameters of vernalization sensitivity and thermal time from floral initiation to flowering were the most influential. Fertilization influenced the rank order of parameter sensitivities more strongly than climate-soil conditions for yield and biomass outputs. Under 0 kg N ha(-1), with the variation of cultivar parameters simulated yield varied from 64 to 3559 kg ha(-1) (minimum and maximum), biomass from 693 to 12,864 kg ha(-1). Fertilization of 100 kg N ha(-1) increased the maximum yield to 9157 kg ha(-1) and biomass to 22,057 kg ha(-1). We conclude that to minimize cultivar-related uncertainty, cultivar parameters should be carefully calibrated when applying the APSIM-wheat model to a new cultivar in a new environment. By targeting the most influential phenological parameters for calibration first and then the yield component parameters, the calibration of APSIM can be streamlined. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM), we simulated the impact on wheat yield of 225 fertilization and residue management scenarios at a high spatial, temporal, and agronomic resolution from 1900 to 2010. The influence of management and environmental variables on wheat yield was then assessed using Spearman's non-parametric correlation test with bootstrapping. While residue management showed little correlation, fertilization strongly increased wheat yield up to around 100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). However, this effect was highly dependent on the key environment variables of rainfall, temperature, and soil water holding capacity. The influence of fertilization on yield was stronger in cooler, wetter climates, and in soils with greater water holding capacity. We conclude that the effectiveness of management intensification to increase wheat yield is highly dependent upon local climate and soil conditions. We provide context-specific information on the yield benefits of fertilization to support adaptive agronomic decision-making and contribute to the closure of yield gaps. We also suggest that future assessments consider the economic and environmental sustainability of management intensification for closing yield gaps.},

	abstract = {Mineral fertiliser is a scarce input for smallholder maize farmers in Malawi. A recent provision of small amounts of subsidised fertilisers by government programmes to farmers throughout Malawi has increased fertiliser access and raised maize production, but fertiliser management and yield responses frequently remain poor. To seek ways to use the fertiliser more efficiently, we analysed the effects of low rates of N (15 or 30 kg N ha(-1)) and P (9 kg P ha(-1)) fertiliser in combination with improved weed management on maize yields in experiments on 12 smallholder farms in Chisepo, central Malawi. Several indices of N and P use efficiency were computed from the above-ground crop components and nutrient contents. Maize yield simulations were conducted using long-term rainfall records in the APSIM crop-soil system model. NP fertiliser significantly (p {\textless} 0.001) raised maize grain yield from 0.65 to 1.5 t ha(-1), and twice-weeding fertilised maize significantly (p {\textless} 0.001) raised maize yields by 0.4 t ha(-1) compared with weeding once (0.9 t ha(-1)). The agronomic efficiency of applied fertiliser N (AE(N)) averaged 19.3 kg grain kg N-1 with one weeding but doubled to 38.7 kg with the additional weeding. The physiological efficiency of applied N (PEN) was 40.7 kg grain kg(-1) N uptake. APSIM predicted that similar or larger maize yield responses to 15 or 30 kg N ha(-1) can be expected in 8 out of 10 years in areas with similar rainfall patterns to Chisepo. A financial analysis showed that the application of these small amounts of fertiliser was economic even when fertiliser was purchased from the open market, provided the crop was adequately weeded. Participatory assessments helped farmers understand the increased efficiency of fertiliser use possible with additional weeding, although some farmers reported difficulty implementing this recommendation due to competing demands for labour. We conclude that to raise the productivity and sustainability of fertiliser support programmes in Malawi, initiatives should be introduced to help identify and educate farmers on the major drivers of productivity in their systems.},

	abstract = {Measurable soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions are recommended to be used in soil organic matter (SOM) models to replace the conceptual pools in order to reduce uncertainty related to model initialization. However, changes in SOM pools require derivation of the decomposition rate for the new pools and also impact on simulation of nutrient cycling in soil. Here, we used the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to explore the impact of adopting measurable SOM pools on simulated SOC and nitrogen dynamics under three agro-ecosystems at Brigalow, Tarlee and Wagga Wagga in Australia. The decomposition rates for the measurable pools were derived based on the data in the top 30 cm soil at Brigalow. With those decomposition rates, the model could predict the variation in observed total SOC, and also captured the dynamics of the measured SOC fractions at the three sites. However, the re-parameterized model overestimated soil nitrogen. Extending the model simulations to centurial scales led to the distinct difference in simulated soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics, due to the difference in pool sizes, decomposition rates and C:N ratios between the two approaches. Sensitivity analysis based on measurable pool approach indicated that simulated soil carbon dynamics was most sensitive to the partitioning of carbon in the sub-pools of new plant material, decomposition rates of particulate and humic organic matter. The simulated soil nitrogen dynamics was most sensitive to the C:N ratio of humic organic matter. In order to accurately simulate the long-term carbon and nitrogen dynamics, more detailed information on the composition of the measurable SOM pools, particularly their C:N ratios and the underlying mechanisms controlling their decomposition and transformation among different pools across different environments are needed.

	volume = {158},
	doi = {10.1016/j.fcr.2013.12.001},
	abstract = {Approximately 15\% of global wheat production (40\% of the wheat produced by developing countries) occurs in irrigated, low-rainfall regions of the subtropics. Irrigated wheat is uncommon in sub-tropical Australia because cotton is more profitable, but high grain prices in 2008 triggered a record area of irrigated wheat production. Unfortunately, widespread lodging occurred and yields were lower than expected, although the losses directly attributable to lodging were unknown. Crop models have not been previously validated for calculating potential yield and yield gaps of mechanised, lodging-susceptible production systems. This study aimed to determine potential yield, farmer-realised yield, and water use requirements of lodging-prone irrigated wheat in sub-tropical Australia, using field monitoring and the APSIM simulation model. Yield data were obtained in 2008 and 2009 from 16 commercial irrigated wheat fields and multiple treatments from four irrigated experiments, and used to assess APSIM's ability to predict grain yield of irrigated wheat. APSIM predicted biomass production satisfactorily in 2008 but substantially over-predicted grain yield of lodged fields. The mean difference (yield gap) between APSIM-estimated potential yield and farmer-realised yield was 1.0 t ha(-1) in non-lodged fields, and 2.7 t ha(-1) in lodged fields. The average effect of lodging was therefore a decrease of 1.7 t ha(-1); the difference between the yield gap calculated for lodged and non-lodged fields. Yield gaps in lodged fields were highly correlated with soil N content at sowing, with most of the lodged fields having more than 300 kg ha(-1) of soil N at sowing to a depth of 90 cm. In 2009, management of commercial fields aimed to avoid lodging by using the canopy management technique of in-season N application. APSIM generally under-predicted biomass production and yield in these fields, suggesting that the N uptake parameters in APSIM may require adjustment. Observed yields from fields of a quick-maturing cultivar that experienced little lodging were simulated accurately when N was assumed to be non-limiting. The simulation study found that the potential yield of irrigated spring wheat in sub-tropical Australia is currently between 8 and 9 t ha(-1), and average growing season evapotranspiration of such crops was approximately 500-550 mm. Potential yield of furrow-irrigated fields with one or two-metre wide beds were 16\% and 8\% lower, due to the area occupied by the 60 cm wide unsown furrows between irrigation beds. This study demonstrated the value of using validated simulation models for estimating potential yield and yield gap analysis. Yield gap analysis also enabled the identification of agronomic characteristics (high levels of soil residual N) which probably contributed to lodging. Further investigation is required to determine whether alternative varieties or the canopy management technique of in-season N application can increase the potential yield of irrigated spring wheat above the levels reported here.

	abstract = {In irrigated cropping, as with any other industry, profit and risk are inter-dependent. An increase in profit would normally coincide with an increase in risk, and this means that risk can be traded for profit. It is desirable to manage a farm so that it achieves the maximum possible profit for the desired level of risk. This paper identifies risk-efficient cropping strategies that allocate land and water between crop enterprises for a case study of an irrigated farm in Southern Queensland, Australia. This is achieved by applying stochastic frontier analysis to the output of a simulation experiment. The simulation experiment involved changes to the levels of business risk by systematically varying the crop sowing rules in a bioeconomic model of the case study farm. This model utilises the multi-field capability of the process based Agricultural Production System Simulator (APSIM) and is parameterised using data collected from interviews with a collaborating farmer. We found sowing rules that increased the farm area sown to cotton caused the greatest increase in risk-efficiency. Increasing maize area also improved risk-efficiency but to a lesser extent than cotton. Sowing rules that increased the areas sown to wheat reduced the risk-efficiency of the farm business. Sowing rules were identified that had the potential to improve the expected farm profit by ca. \$50,000 Annually, without significantly increasing risk. The concept of the shadow price of risk is discussed and an expression is derived from the estimated frontier equation that quantifies the trade-off between profit and risk.

Data on daily temperature, precipitation, and sunshine hours for 50 years (1956-2006) were analysed to build climate scenarios for three categories of ENSO: years with El Nino events, years with La Nina events, and neutral years. The pattern of climate change was generally similar across the three sites: annual precipitation decreased slightly and annual mean sunshine hours decreased significantly, whereas annual mean minimum temperature increased significantly, leading to a significant increase in mean air temperature. Precipitation decreased and temperature and sunshine hours increased in both El Nino and La Nina years but remained stable in neutral years. Under full irrigation, the probability of exceeding distribution that crop yield would be higher was not markedly affected (P {\textgreater} 0.05), although the yields in both El Nino and La Nina years differed markedly from those in neutral years, especially in maize. Under rain-fed conditions, the yield of maize was decreased greatly (P {\textless} 0.05), the probability distribution of such reduction being the highest in La Nina years at all the sites (P {\textless} 0.05). At the provincial level, yields from well-managed fields differed (P[ 0.05) with the ENSO category: production of maize was more vulnerable than that of wheat in El Nino and La Nina years. El Nino and La Nina had similar effects on climatic variables across the NCP: low yields in El Nino and La Nina years due to lower precipitation and high yields in neutral years due to longer sunshine hours and additional irrigation.},

	abstract = {The complexities and challenges in quantifying N leaching have led to development of a range of measurement and modelling techniques, but none are widely applied. Observations that N moves more slowly than water through the soil profile has resulted in different approaches being used to simulate impeded N movement in crop models: (i) by accounting for nitrate (NO3-) adsorption to the soil, (ii) by considering incomplete mixing between resident and draining soil water fractions or (iii) a combination of both. We compare and discuss strengths and weaknesses of these approaches. Our inability to directly measure model parameters (especially with regards to simulating N dynamics), and the risk of compensating errors during model testing and calibration, often results in low confidence in simulated N leaching. We caution that our current ability to simulate N leaching is in most cases not yet well enough developed for reliable and accurate predictions. We recommend a more strategic approach involving better linking measurement and modelling to improve understanding of the critical soil processes that control N leaching as one way of further improving our understanding and quantification of N leaching.

	doi = {10.1007/s00704-013-0895-z},
	abstract = {Conceptions encompassing climate change are irreversible rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, increased temperature, and changes in rainfall both in spatial- and temporal-scales worldwide. This will have a major impact on wheat production, particularly if crops are frequently exposed to a sequence, frequency, and intensity of specific weather events like high temperature during growth period. However, the process of wheat response to climate change is complex and compounded by interactions among atmospheric CO2 concentration(,) climate variables, soil, nutrition, and agronomic management. In this study, we use the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM)-wheat model, driven by statistically downscaled climate projections of 18 global circulation models (GCMs) under the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A2 CO2 emission scenario to examine impact on future wheat yields across key wheat growing regions considering different soil types in New South Wales (NSW) of Australia. The response of wheat yield, yield components, and phenology vary across sites and soil types, but yield is closely related to plant available water capacity (PAWC). Results show a decreasing yield trend during the period of 2021-2040 compared to the baseline period of 1961-1990. Across different wheat-growing regions in NSW, grain yield difference in the future period (2021-2040) over the baseline (1961-1990) varies from +3.4 to -14.7 \%, and in most sites, grain number is decreased, while grain size is increased in future climate. Reduction of wheat yield is mainly due to shorter growth duration, where average flowering and maturing time are advanced by an average of 11 and 12 days, respectively. In general, larger negative impacts of climate change are exhibited in those sites with higher PAWC. Current wheat cultivars with shorter growing season properties are viable in the future climate, but breading for early sowing wheat varieties with longer growing duration will be a desirable adaptation strategy for mitigating the impact of changing climate on wheat yield.},

	abstract = {Attention to farm management practices that enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) stock is increasing because of the latter's importance of soil fertility, crop production and the global carbon cycle. Sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) as SOC has potential feedback to climate change. Spatial modelling of the effects of wheat stubble incorporation by tillage on SOC storage was studied in a semi-arid rainfed wheat cropping system, using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM). The model was validated against a long-term (1979-2004) experiment and yielded a Ratio of Performance to Deviation (RPD) of 1.6 and R-2 of 0.63, indicating a moderate accuracy in predicting SOC turnover. In the Liverpool Plains and the southern slopes of NSW, SOC at top 30 cm layer is in a higher range of 40-50 t ha(-1), while from the southern west plains to the northern plains extending to the New England tablelands, SOC is in a lower range of 25-35 t ha(-1). It is notable that SOC in the central slopes is also in the lower range of 25-35 t ha(-1). There is large simulated variation to changes in SOC from stubble management under the current climate that ranges from 0 to -200 kg ha(-1) year(-1) when 100\% of the wheat stubble is removed. When 100\% of the wheat stubble is 100\% incorporated, the changes in SOC become positive, from 0 to 200 kg ha(-1) year(-1). The SOC change patterns associated with the rates of wheat stubble incorporation are similar under a projected future climate. However, as future temperatures rise, less SOC will be sequestered. For example, under the 100\% removal of wheat stubble, the averaged SOC is decreased by 126 +/-},

	volume = {36},
	doi = {10.1080/07060661.2013.870230},
	abstract = {Fungicides are the last line of defence in the armoury of an integrated disease management (IDM) approach. They do not create yield, but protect an inherent yield potential that the grower may realize in the absence of disease. In the field, securing effective disease control from fungicide applications is dependent upon the disease pressure and the effectiveness of the fungicide to control that disease. Globally, the same fungicide active ingredients are used against a similar range of fungal pathogens. However, in the presence of the pathogen, the level of economic response to fungicide applications is primarily driven by the prevailing environmental conditions and their interactions with crop development and the pathogen. Fungicides are canopy management tools that influence the size and duration of the green leaf area (GLA) of the crop. The total number of fungicide applications links to the length of the growing season and the disease risk in that period. For example, the top three leaves of a wheat crop canopy might warrant protection for approximately 120 days in an irrigated wheat crop on the Canterbury Plains of New Zealand, but only 60 days in the dry land wheat crops of the Victorian Mallee in Australia. Combining our knowledge of fungicide effect on the crop canopy with soil water and nutrient availability enables better matching of fungicide product, dose and timing to a specific disease risk. It also enables better use of crop physiology models, such as APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator), to assist with in-crop fungicide decisions. This paper reviews the role of fungicides, principally the triazoles (FRAC Group 3), strobilurins (Group 11) and SDHI's succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (Group 7), in cereal disease management. It explains (i) why applying foliar fungicide by plant development stage (as well as disease threshold) confers advantages when fungicide mode of action and on-farm logistics are taken into consideration; (ii) gives examples of how fungicide management strategies are adjusted in Australia and New Zealand to take account of environmental conditions; and (iii) explains the importance of green leaf retention (GLR) in the realization of an economic response from fungicides. ResumeLes fongicides constituent l'ultime ligne de defense dans l'arsenal d'une approche de gestion des maladies par lutte integree. Ils n'accroissent pas le rendement, mais protegent le rendement possible qu'un producteur pourrait obtenir en l'absence de maladies. Au champ, la lutte efficace contre les maladies decoulant de l'application de fongicides depend de la pression exercee par la maladie et de l'efficacite du fongicide a lutter contre cette maladie. Globalement, les memes ingredients actifs d'un fongicide sont utilises contre une gamme d'agents pathogenes fongiques similaires. Toutefois, en presence d'un agent pathogene, le niveau de reponse economique aux applications de fongicide est avant tout conditionne par les conditions courantes du milieu et leurs interactions avec le developpement vegetatif et l'agent pathogene. Les fongicides sont des outils de gestion du couvert vegetal qui influencent la taille et la duree de la surface foliaire verte de la culture. Le nombre total d'applications de fongicide est lie a la longueur de la saison de croissance et au risque d'incidence de la maladie durant cette periode. Par exemple, les trois feuilles superieures du ble, en tant que couvert vegetal, peuvent offrir une protection pendant environ 120 jours dans un champ irrigue dans les plaines de Canterbury en Nouvelle-Zelande, mais seulement 60 sur les terres arides du Mallee australien de la region de Victoria. La combinaison de nos connaissances sur les effets des fongicides sur le couvert vegetal de la culture a l'eau du sol et a la disponibilite des nutriments permet de mieux cibler le produit ainsi que la quantite a utiliser et de synchroniser son application en fonction du risque possible d'une maladie particuliere. Cela permet egalement une meilleure utilisation des modeles physiologiques des cultures comme APSIM (Agricultural Production System Simulator) afin d'aider dans le choix du fongicide pour la premiere application de postlevee. Cet article passe en revue le role des fongicides, principalement des triazoles (FRAC Groupe 3), des strobilurines (Groupe 11) et des inhibiteurs de la succinate deshydrogenase (Groupe 7) dans la gestion des maladies des cereales. Il explique pourquoi l'application d'un fongicide foliaire en fonction des stades de developpement de la plante (et du seuil de la maladie) offre des avantages quand le mode d'action du fongicide et la logistique associee a la ferme sont pris en consideration; il donne des exemples de l'adaptation des strategies de gestion des fongicides utilisees en Australie et en Nouvelle-Zelande visant a prendre en compte les conditions de milieu; et il explique l'importance de la retention de la surface foliaire verte afin d'obtenir une reponse economique a l'utilisation des fongicides.},

	abstract = {The performance of APSIM model in simulating soil moisture dynamics and plant growth and production for lucerne ( Medicago sativa L.) crop was assessed against the crop observations from three sites in semi-arid Ningxia region of Western China. The model parameters for characterizing plant growth and development for local cultivar, Guyuan lucerne ( Medicago sativa L. 'Guyuan'), were specified or estimated using try-and-error methods based on the detailed observations at one site (Guyuan). Then the model performance in simulating crop phenological development and dry matter production was compared with the observations at another two sites (Tongxin and Yinchuan) to validate the model parameterization. The simulations used local meteorological data and soil profile description at each sites. The results showed that modeled plant phenological development (number of days from sowing to emergence, floral initiation and flowering) matched excellently with the observed at both sites ( R2=0.99, D=0. 99, NRMSE=2.4\% at Tongxin and R2=1.00, D=0.99, NRMSE=7.8\% at Yinchuan, respectively); modeled plant dry matter production agreed well with the observed ( R2=0.82, D=0.99, NRMRE=7.1\% at Tongxin and R2=0.98, D=0.99, NRMSE=9.3\% at Yinchuan, respectively), though a slight overestimation (7.1\% on average); and modeled soil moisture also agreed reasonably to the observed ( R2=0. 82, D=0.85, NRMSE=10\%), also with a overestimation (10.1\% on average). Slightly overestimation of plant production is most likely related with the overestimation of soil moisture, which suggests more detailed measurements being needed for describing soil profiles and improving model predictions. This model parameterization and validation provides the confidence for using the model to optimize crop management, and assess climate change impacts in the semiarid area of Ningxia.},

	abstract = {This paper compared several famous phasic development models in wheat to provide the reference for improving the performance of phasic development model. CERES-Wheat, APSIM-Wheat, and WheatGrow models were chosen to compare the differences in phase division, cultivar parameter, model algorithm, and estimating performance. The results showed that the development stages were estimated with the accumulated thermal time in models of CERES-Wheat and APSIM-Wheat, while physiological development time was used in WheatGrow model. In addition, apical development was used to predict the phasic development in WheatGrow as well. Two more cultivar parameters, intrinsic earliness(IE) and temperature sensitivity (ts), were used in WheatGrow model than in models of CERES-Wheat and APSIM-Wheat. Polygonal function was used to describe the effects of temperature on development rate in CERES-Wheat and APSIM-Wheat models. However, the sine-exponential and cosine-exponential functions were used in WheatGrow model. Vernalization effectiveness factor in CERES-Wheat and APSIM-Wheat models were calculated by empirical function based on the mean daily temperature, while in the WheatGrow model, calculated by piecewise function based on the mean daily temperature. The quadratic function was used to describe the photoperiod effectiveness in all models. In this paper, the observed data of field experiments under different sowing dates and planting densities at different eco-sites in Jiangsu Province and a pot experiment with different temperature treatments after flowering was used to test the performance of above three models. The results showed that the RMSE (root mean square error) between simulated and observed growth durations was 1 to 2 days under normal temperature environment in field experiments. However, the simulation results showed a poor performance under extreme high-temperature after flowering for all three models, with RMSE of about 4 to 5 days. The best performances for maturity and anthesis estimation are CERES-Wheat and WheatGrow models, respectively. In addition, we must pay more attention to improving the estimating accuracy of wheat phasic development models under extreme high temperature after flowering.},

The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) was used, with generic soil profiles based on descriptions of LUC classes, to generate pasture growth curves (PGCs) in three regions of the country. The simulated pasture yields were similar to the estimates in the LRI spatial database, and varied with LUC Class within and across regions. The simulated PGCs also agreed well with measured data.

We investigated the effects of N fertiliser management on pasture production and modelled N losses, either via direct leaching of fertiliser N, or indirectly through N uptake and subsequent excretion via dairy cow grazing. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) was first tested with experimental data from fertiliser response experiments conducted on a well-drained soil in the Waikato region of New Zealand. The model was then used in a 20-year simulation to investigate the effect of fertiliser management on pasture response and the impacts on potential leaching losses. The risk of direct leaching from applied fertiliser was generally low, but at an annual rate of 220 kg N/ha exceeded that from urine patches in one out of 10 years. The main effect of N fertiliser on leaching risk was indirect via the urine patch by providing higher pasture yields and N concentrations. Best management practices could include identification of high risk periods based on environmental conditions (e.g. soil moisture, plant growth), avoidance of fertiliser applications in these periods and the use of duration controlled grazing (DCG) to prevent excreta deposition onto the grazing area during critical times.},

	abstract = {Post-rainy sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) production underpins the livelihood of millions in the semiarid tropics, where the crop is affected by drought. Drought scenarios have been classified and quantified using crop simulation. In this report, variation in traits that hypothetically contribute to drought adaptation (plant growth dynamics, canopy and root water conducting capacity, drought stress responses) were virtually introgressed into the most common post-rainy sorghum genotype, and the influence of these traits on plant growth, development, and grain and stover yield were simulated across different scenarios. Limited transpiration rates under high vapour pressure deficit had the highest positive effect on production, especially combined with enhanced water extraction capacity at the root level. Variability in leaf development (smaller canopy size, later plant vigour or increased leaf appearance rate) also increased grain yield under severe drought, although it caused a stover yield trade-off under milder stress. Although the leaf development response to soil drying varied, this trait had only a modest benefit on crop production across all stress scenarios. Closer dissection of the model outputs showed that under water limitation, grain yield was largely determined by the amount of water availability after anthesis, and this relationship became closer with stress severity. All traits investigated increased water availability after anthesis and caused a delay in leaf senescence and led to a 'stay-green' phenotype. In conclusion, we showed that breeding success remained highly probabilistic; maximum resilience and economic benefits depended on drought frequency. Maximum potential could be explored by specific combinations of traits.},

Whole-farm simulation analyses using the APSIM and GRAZPLAN models at nine locations across southern Australia have evaluated the likely trade-offs among expected profitability, financial risk, soil erosion risk, deep drainage and soil carbon change as annual pastures are converted to perennial pastures based on a C-3 grass, a C-4 grass or lucerne. Differences between perennial and annual feedbases in total pasture growth (median -11\%, range -47\% to +20\%) and metabolisable energy supply from pasture (median +1\%, range -48\% to +52\%) were diverse across locations and perennial species. At some locations, improvements in the pasture feedbase were counter-balanced by lower livestock intakes from crop stubbles. The modelled farming system with the highest profit included some perennial pasture at seven of the nine locations, but no one pasture species or land-use system predominated across all locations or producer risk attitudes. Local characteristics of the soils and farming systems are as important as broad climatic factors in determining how substituting perennial for annual pastures alters the trade-off between profitability and wind erosion risk. Further expanding permanent pastures into land currently used for crops only unequivocally reduced wind erosion risk at the four locations with Mediterranean climates. Lucerne grown in long rotations provided the best trade-off between mean gross margin and financial risk at Merriwagga and Temora. Permanent C-3 or C-4 perennial grass pastures separated from continuous cropping may simultaneously increase profits and reduce business and erosion risk at low-rainfall locations with Mediterranean climates, as long as they can be managed to persist. Managing pastures for greater nitrogen inputs could be considered as an erosion-abatement strategy.},

In these semi-arid and arid environments, saltbush is valuable for increasing the production from otherwise marginal areas of the farm and during drought periods when there are few feed alternatives. The ability to predict the growth and development of perennial forages such as old man saltbush in response to rainfall, soils and farm management is necessary for farming system planning and design purposes. A field experiment was conducted at Waikerie, South Australia, to inform the development of a new forage shrub model for use in the APSIM framework. The model takes into account the common setup of saltbush plantations in alley systems, by simulating light interception and water uptake for interacting shrub and inter-row zones separately. This is done by modelling the canopy and root system development. Field data across three soil types along a landscape catena showed that the model was able to satisfactorily predict daily biomass accumulation, partitioning into leaf and woody biomass, and regrowth after grazing. The model was sensitive to properties associated with the root system, and with limited parameterisation can be tailored to simulate different clonal cultivars. The model can now be used in the APSIM framework to assess temporal and spatial dynamics of forage systems combining shrubs with herbaceous pasture components.},

These studies usually process RCM output to remove errors in the simulated climate. However, this paper investigates the suitability of raw output from simulations of a single RCM as input to a biophysical impact model. Our study analyses errors in wheat yields simulated for New South Wales (NSW), Australia by the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model forced with output from 2 RCM simulations with horizontal resolutions of approximately 50 and 10 km over NSW and with output from the global climate model (GCM) simulation that they downscale. Overall, across the NSW wheat belt, the similar to 50 km simulation has a better simulation of mean yields for the 1990-2010 period than the GCM simulation, and the similar to 10 km simulation has a better simulation than the similar to 50 km simulation. The average mean yield from APSIM simulations forced with observations is 3.5 t ha(-1). The average magnitudes of errors in mean yields for the GCM, similar to 50 km and similar to 10 km simulations are 1.2, 1.0 and 0.5 t ha(-1) respectively. We suggest that the improvement in the simulation of mean yields with increasing climate model resolution is largely due to an improvement in the simulation of mean rainfall totals for the growing season. However, for a given value of mean growing season total rainfall, all 3 climate model simulations have a climate that is more conducive to high yields than the observed climate. This difference must be due to errors in other aspects of the simulated climates.},

There is a pressing need to define times, locations and climates that are suitable for pasture cropping. To evaluate effects of management interventions, agro-environment, and possible interactions on crop and pasture productivity associated with pasture cropping, an AusFarm (R) simulation model was built to describe a pasture-cropping system based on annual crop and subtropical grass. The model was parameterised using data from field research on pasture cropping with barley cv. Buloke and a C-4 subtropical grass, Gatton panic (Panicum maximum cv. Gatton), conducted at Moora, Western Australia. The simulation was run over 50 years using the historical climate data of five southern Australian locations (Cunderdin, Jerdacuttup, Mingenew, and Moora in Western Australia, and Karoonda in South Australia). Two wheat cultivars and one barley crop were considered for each location, to examine the impact of crop phenology on this farming system. Jerdacuttup and Moora favoured pasture cropping, with average barley-yield penalties of 10 and 12\%. These locations were characterised by colder growing seasons, more plant-available water at anthesis, and more winter-spring rain. The cereal crops did not rely on stored soil moisture, growing instead on incident rain. The winter-spring growth of the Gatton panic pasture was highest at Mingenew. This generated a high yield penalty, 38\% loss under pasture cropping, compared with the other locations. Changing the efficacy of a herbicide application to the pasture when the crop was sown had a strong effect on yield. Yield penalties at Moora and Mingenew reduced to 7 and 29\%, respectively, when the proportion of live biomass killed by the herbicide was doubled. Utilisation of soil moisture by the Gatton panic pasture during summer and early autumn had little effect on subsequent grain yield, whereas reduced pasture growth during the winter-spring growing period had a substantial effect on crop yield. Pasture cropping can therefore succeed in agro-climatic regions where crops can be grown on incident rain and pasture growth is suppressed through low temperature or herbicide. Perennial pasture growth should be minimised during the crop growing period through the management of crop sowing date, nitrogen fertiliser application and C4 grass suppression to minimise the effect on stored soil water at crop anthesis.},

	title = {Detailed trait characterisation is needed for simulation of cultivar responses to water stress.},
	abstract = {THE POTENTIAL of crop modelling to aid farm management decisions has been demonstrated in the sugar industry. Models such as the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) have been used in scheduling irrigation and fertilisation and for forecasting yields. APSIM models were developed based on cultivar parameters of a limited number of traits such as leaf area and how biomass is partitioned. Many of these trait parameters use the same value for all cultivars because they have not been measured or defined for different genotypes. The cultivars included in the model are no longer widely used for commercial applications and may not represent the genetic and phenological variability found in currently grown cultivars. This could reduce the accuracy of simulated results for new cultivars. To improve APSIM as a decision support system, deficiencies in APSIM's ability to simulate cultivar differences should be identified. The biomass yields of four commercially released sugarcane cultivars that are currently defined within APSIM were simulated in this paper. These cultivars were also grown under water stressed and fully irrigated conditions at Home Hill over three years. An exploratory data analysis procedure compared simulated and observed differences between cultivars. Further, a descriptive sensitivity analysis that varied the transpiration efficiency parameter ( k) in APSIM demonstrated how additional cultivar-specific parameters can affect yield simulations. Simulated yields closely resembled observed yields if cultivar differences were ignored. However, APSIM did not contain many trait parameter differences between cultivars and this limited the ability of APSIM to reproduce observed cultivar responses to water stress. To simulate these interactions effectively, cultivars need to be accurately defined in the model. Incrementally adjusting k as part of the sensitivity analysis had a large effect on simulated yields. Under stressed conditions, k values as low as 6.1 g kPa/kg and as high as 12.1 g kPa/kg were required to closely simulate mean observed yields for different cultivars. This varied from the default APSIM value of 8 g kPa/kg. This paper illustrated the need for accurate characterisation of cultivar-specific traits to improve simulation of cultivar performance in different environments. Future research must consider the effect of all cultivar-specific parameters to identify which parameters have the greatest effect on simulated yields. Cultivar-specific modelling can potentially be used to identify ideal cultivars for specific environments and to tailor management strategies to specific combinations of cultivars and environments.},

These detection and attribution studies are particularly challenging in agricultural systems where other factors (such as management) are changing over time. Here we consider changes in pasture yield (net herbage accumulation [NHA]) over the period 1960-2004 in a dataset from a trial in New Zealand where management (grazing protocol and fertiliser application) was constant over time. We used 2 approaches: a statistical approach looking for trends in, and correlations between, NHA and climate variables and a process-based modelling approach where combinations of variables were held constant at their starting values or allowed to change with time enabling us to isolate the impact of individual factors. There was a significant positive trend for NHA in spring over the period and positive trends in rainfall and atmospheric CO2 concentration; soil nitrogen (N) also increased over time. The statistical approach was useful for identifying trends but was unable to resolve the driving variables. Modelling identified CO2, soil properties and their interaction as the most influential variables. The calculated impact of CO2 was a 0.21\% increase in NHA ppm CO2-1; this compares to a value of 0.19\% from a FACE (free air carbon dioxide enrichment) experiment with a similar type of management and pattern of pasture production. The results instill confidence in experimental estimates of the CO2 fertilisation effect, particularly at low levels of CO2 enrichment, and provide evidence that climate change impacts are already in progress.},

It was found that wheat production was not only affected by total annual precipitation, but variations in growth period precipitation were affected too. The most effective precipitation period was the seedling stage, followed by the jointing stage, flag-leaf stage, heading stage, filling stage and flowering stage. The correlation between precipitation and wheat yield during the seedling stage and jointing stage showed a downward opening parabola. The effects of precipitation in the seedling stage and jointing stage were 6.6 and 3.7 times those of precipitation in flag-leaf stage, respectively. The effects of precipitation in heading stage, flag-leaf stage, flowering stage and filling stage on wheat yield showed secondary superposition of incremental trends during the studied area. The precipitation in the seedling and elongation stage was one of the main limiting factors on wheat yield in this studied area.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the effects of predicted changes in rainfall distribution in marginal ({\textless}= 325 mm annual rainfall) parts of the south-west Australian wheatbelt and options for management and adaptation of the wheat crop. Field experiments with rain-out shelters and irrigation were conducted in 2008 and 2009 to investigate the interactions of rainfall distribution, row spacing, genotype and timing of nitrogen application on growth, water use and grain yield of spring wheat. Water storage before seeding showed potential to maintain or increase yields despite lower in-season rainfall. Widening row spacing reduced biomass and slowed water use but did not increase grain yield, because of increased soil evaporation and water left in the soil at crop maturity. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) wheat model was used to investigate the effects of recent and projected climate change on yield in relation to row spacing, phenology and nitrogen. Two climate-change scenarios were applied to historical climatic data to create two plausible future climates ('optimistic' and 'pessimistic') for the year 2030. None of the strategies tested increased wheat yield under the predicted climate scenarios. Simulated yields at wider row spacings were consistently lower due to insufficient biomass, increased soil evaporation and the inability of the crop to use all of the available water before maturity. Simulated yields of short-season genotypes were always greater than yields of longer season genotypes. Nitrogen regimes had little effect in this study. This study points to several genotypic traits that could improve the performance of wheat grown at wider row spacings. These include early vigour to reduce soil evaporation and increase competition with weeds, greater tillering/biomass to reduce limitation by sink size, and a vigorous root system with appropriate lateral spread and growth to depth to access available soil water.},

Moench) var. Tegemeo under current and future climate in central Tanzania. Simulations for both current and future periods were run assuming present technology, current varieties and current agronomy packages to investigate rain-fed sorghum yield response. Simulations by both crop models using downscaled weather data from eight General Circulation Models (GCMs) under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP 4.5) by mid-century show a mixture of increase and decrease in median sorghum yields. Four GCMs project yields to increase by 5\%-23.0\% and one GCM show a decrease by 2\%-9\%. Model simulations under the remaining three GCMs give contrasting results of increase and decrease. Adjustment of crop duration to mimic the choice of growing local cultivars versus improved cultivars seems a feasible option under future climate scenarios. Our simulation results show that current open-pollinated sorghum cultivars would be resilient to projected changes in climate by 2050s but things seem better with long duration cultivars. We conclude that crop simulation models show their applicability as tools for assessing possible impacts of climate change on sorghum due to agreement in the direction of crop yield predictions in five out of eight selected GCMs under projected climate scenarios. The findings provide useful guidance and motivation to government authorities and development agencies dealing with food security issues to prioritize adaptations policies geared to ensuring increased and sustained sorghum productivity in Tanzania and elsewhere.},

Increased variability of seasonal rainfall as a result of climate change will further exacerbate risk in rice cultivation. Knowing the onset of rainfall through forecasts, adjusting planting date based on the predicted rainfall onset, and efficient irrigation management are important determinants to reduce the risk in rice farming. In this study, a modelling approach was used to assess the yield advantage of changing planting dates according to the onset of seasonal rainfall compared to a fixed planting date in the major rainy season (Maha), and evaluated the efficiency of irrigation management. The model, Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM), was parameterized using data from the literature, and the model could simulate the observed yield of rice varieties Bg300 and Bg359 with a good fit (CV{\textless}14\%). Simulations carried out for Bg300, the rice variety that has recorded the largest extent of cultivation in Sri Lanka, revealed that changing the planting date according to the onset of rainfall can reduce the irrigation water requirement and yield loss. Early onset coupled with early planting resulted in an average yield of 3900150 kg/ha, which was 33\% higher than that of late planting with the same onset. Late onset coupled with late planting resulted in an average yield of (3930200 kg/ha), which was 34\% higher than that of early planting with a late onset. Moreover, late planting at a late onset resulted in a higher variability in water productivity (4.30.34 kg/ha/mm) when compared to an early planting at an early onset (4.40.12 kg/ha/mm), even though the mean water productivity was similar. Therefore, timing of rice planting should be adjusted based on the forecast of the onset of seasonal rainfall to harness the maximum potential of available natural resources.},

However, there have been some studies to quantify the impact of irrigation regimes and N fertilizer rates. While experimental data to analyse the response of canola growth are limited to a few seasons, combining these data with modelling provides an efficient means to study the optimized irrigation level and N application rate for Canola in Yangtze River Basin. The APSIM-Canola model was calibrated and tested using data from three field experimental sites in the Yangtze River Basin. The model was able to simulate onset of phenological stages with different sowing dates, and to explain 75\% of the variation in biomass and yield. From the historical climate analysis, the temperature difference were increased by -0.015, 0.011, and -0.025°C per year in Nanjing, Shimen and Wuhan, respectively. For Radiation and rainfall, the total radiation had reduced by 7.498 and 7.089 MJ/m 2 in Wuhan and Nanjing, but increased by 5.488 MJ/m 2 in Shimen. The total rainfall increased by 0.761 and 3.928 mm in Wuhan and Nanjing, but decreased by 4.309 mm in Shimen. Based on the APSIM parameters were comprehensively sensitivity analysis and calibration, we analysed the yield fluctuation with no irrigation cases in three sites which were under different annual precipitation type and different nitrogen application levels. It was found that when no nitrogen was applied, yield varied sharply with the rainfall fluctuations in different year type. Three areas became stable gradually when nitrogen fertilizer was applied. The influence of rainfall yielded minimum when nitrogen level was applied with 50 kg/ha and 150 kg/ha and 200 kg/ha in Nanjing, Wuhan and Shimen, respectively. We also try to choose optimum policy which gives consideration both for yield and the use efficiency of nitrogen application and irrigation from nine scenarios. The optimal irrigation and fertilization management measures can be achieved when the irrigation quantity achieved 30\% and nitrogen quantity for 180 kg/ha at Wuhan site.},

	abstract = {The impact of cropping on the hydrology and fertility of Vertosols in the northern Darling Basin (average annual rainfall {\textgreater}550mm) has received much attention, together with the constraints placed on crop growth by naturally occurring subsoil salt stocks. These factors have not been quantified in the drier (450-550mm), marginal cropping areas to the west. With widespread adoption of zero tillage technology and the potential for large increases in the capture and storage of rainfall in good seasons, mobilisation of salt could be exacerbated should crop water use be constrained by salt toxicity and/or nutrient deficiency. We investigated the size of salt stocks, historic deep drainage, and nutrient depletion under continuous cropping in the Grey and Brown Vertosols of the Walgett and Coonamble districts of north-western NSW. Soils collected from seven paired sites (cropped v. control native vegetation) showed chloride concentrations {\textgreater}500mg/kg within 0-1.2m, high exchangeable sodium percentage (similar to 30\%) at depth and deficiency in phosphorus, manganese and zinc. Soil total nitrogen decreased from an average stock of 4.9t/ha at a rate of 0.008t/ha.year under cropping within 0-0.1m and soil carbon stocks decreased from 39t/ha by 0.20t/ha.year within 0-0.5m.. Despite low rainfall, high evaporation and the large water-holding capacity of the cracking clays, there were significant downward shifts in chloride concentrations under cropping. Estimates of deep drainage under continuous cropping using chloride mass balance, chloride-front displacement and crop water-balance modelling with the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) generally agreed (range 0.1-2\% of average annual rainfall). Simulations suggested that deep drainage may be increased 5-10-fold under zero-tillage winter cropping due to enhanced capture of rainfall by zero tillage compared with traditional practices. The associated flushing of salt from the root-zone together with correction of nutrient deficiency would enhance crop water use and productivity. Current methods indicate little storage in the subsoil for future deep drainage and that hydraulic conductivity is very low. Hence, the long-term effects of any increase in drainage rates, due to changes in cropping practices and/or climate, on the potential for salinisation of groundwater or transient water logging of the surface, are equivocal.},

In present studies, APSIM was calibrated and validated to predict nitrogen use efficiency of wheat under rain-fed conditions for Pothwar region of Pakistan. Field experiments were laid out using RCBD four factor factorial design replicated four times at PMAS-Arid Agriculture University, Rawalpindi Research area. Two wheat genotypes were planted during years (2010-11 and 2011-12) using different nitrogen rates [N0 (No fertilizer), N 50 (50 kg ha -1), N 100 (100 kg ha -1) and N 150 (150 kg ha -1)] and application methods by keeping individual plot size of 4 m * 6 m and row spacing of 25 cm. Maximum nitrogen use efficiency (108.49 kg kg -1) was calculated for N 0 while minimum NUE (25.47 kg kg -1) calculated for N 150. Split dose application method gave more NUE (58.95 kg kg -1) than full dose nitrogen application method (53.77 kg kg -1). Genotype NARC-2009 performed better and gave maximum NUE (60.55 kg kg -1), while minimum NUE (52.17 kg kg -1) was calculated for Chakwal-50. Similarly, during 2010-11, more NUE (60.19 kg kg -1) was calculated than 2011-12 (50.52 kg kg -1). Days to maturity, biomass nitrogen, grain yield and grain nitrogen were recorded from the field experiment as well as simulated by APSIM model. The simulated outcomes for all these parameters were strongly correlated. The simulation depicted a strong dependency of the mineral nitrogen concentration upon plant nitrogen uptake and growth. The validation skill scores like R 2 and RMSE confirmed the ability of APSIM to model nitrogen use efficiency in wheat under rain-fed conditions. Therefore, simulation modeling approaches should be adopted to recommend optimum fertilizer dose and timing to get maximum crop yield and eliminate nitrogen losses in the context of extreme climate variability.},

	abstract = {Rain-fed crop production systems in the semi-arid tropics of Zimbabwe are characterized by low water productivity (WP), which is partly attributed to inherent low soil fertility, and further exacerbated by continuous cropping without addition of adequate organic and inorganic fertilizers due to unavailability and high costs. A simulation modeling approach was used to evaluate potential interventions that can be used as entry points to improve crop water productivity. Low-cost interventions that use locally available organic inputs were evaluated using the Agriculture Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM). The farmer practice (FP) was compared to interventions comprising manure application (MN) and maize-mucuna rotation (MMR). Their potential effects on crop water productivity, dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) were assessed. Average maize grain water productivity was 0.32, 0.40 and 0.70 kg m(-3) under the FP, MN and MMR treatments, respectively, while that of mucuna biomass (Mucuna pruriens) was 1.34 kg m(-3). Cropping under the FP and MN treatments showed negative trends in SOC and TN over 30 years, with average losses ranging from 17 to 74 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) and 6 to 16 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. In contrast, the MMR treatment showed positive trends in both soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN). The SOC and TN increased by 2.6-194 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) and 6-14 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. According to the simulation results it can be concluded that the MMR treatment can improve the water productivity of smallholder maize systems in the semi-arid areas of Zimbabwe under nutrient-depleted soil conditions and can also contribute to the building up of SOC and TN.

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is one of the macro nutrients required by crops, and is deficient in many agricultural soils. Due to the low recovery and residual effects of applied P, long-term measurements are required to quantify crop response to P inputs. A modelling approach enables integration of available data to investigate response of crops to P additions in different soils. The APSIM agricultural production systems model has an ability to simulate crop response to soil P. However, the model has only been tested against a few datasets for maize, sorghum and bean crops outside Australia. It has not been applied to Australian conditions, nor against other crops. In this paper we derived the model parameters for wheat, soybean and peanut based on literature and measurement data. The parameterised model was tested for simulation of biomass growth, grain yield, P uptake and grain P contents of four crops (wheat, maize, soybean and peanut) in response to different levels of P addition in a 6-year rotation on a Red Ferrosol soil at Kingaroy, Queensland, Australia. Overall, the model could explain 87\% of the variation in observed total aboveground biomass, 84\% in grain yield, 75\% in crop P uptake and 73\% in P content in grain. It was also able to reflect the differential P recovery of crops in the rotation under the 5 different P input levels. In addition, a close relationship was found between modelled labile P and measured bicarbonate extractable P (Colwell P), which may help to initialise APSIM using Colwell P measurements in future studies. It is noted that much of the uncertainties in modelling crop response to phosphorus input arise from the uncertainties in input variables, particularly those describing soil P sorption capacities. Unless P sorption characteristics of a soil in a particular region are quantified, it remains difficult to conduct meaningful modelling research or develop model applications.

	abstract = {Ecosystem models play a crucial role in understanding and evaluating the combined impacts of rising atmospheric CO 2 concentration and changing climate on terrestrial ecosystems. However, we are not aware of any studies where the capacity of models to simulate intra- and inter-annual variation in responses to elevated CO 2 has been tested against long-term experimental data. Here we tested how well the ecosystem model APSIM/AgPasture was able to simulate the results from a free air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) experiment on grazed pasture. At this FACE site, during 11 years of CO 2 enrichment, a wide range in annual plant production response to CO 2 (-6 to +28\%) was observed. As well as running the full model, which includes three plant CO 2 response functions (plant photosynthesis, nitrogen (N) demand and stomatal conductance), we also tested the influence of these three functions on model predictions. Model/data comparisons showed that: (i) overall the model over-predicted the mean annual plant production response to CO 2 (18.5\% cf 13.1\%) largely because years with small or negative responses to CO 2 were not well simulated; (ii) in general seasonal and inter-annual variation in plant production responses to elevated CO 2 were well represented by the model; (iii) the observed CO 2 enhancement in overall mean legume content was well simulated but year-to-year variation in legume content was poorly captured by the model; (iv) the best fit of the model to the data required all three CO 2 response functions to be invoked; (v) using actual legume content and reduced N fixation rate under elevated CO 2 in the model provided the best fit to the experimental data. We conclude that in temperate grasslands the N dynamics (particularly the legume content and N fixation activity) play a critical role in pasture production responses to elevated CO 2, and are processes for model improvement.},

We found that during 1980-2009 cultivars renewal contributed to yield increase by 12.2-22.6\%; fertilization management contributed to yield increase by 2.1-3.6\%; and climate change contributed to yield generally by -3.0-3.0\%, however by -15.0\% for rainfed wheat in southern part of the NCP. Modern cultivars and agronomic management played dominant roles in yield increase in the past three decades, nevertheless the estimated impacts of climate change on yield accounted for as large as -23.8-25.0\% of observed yield trends. During the study period, increase in temperature increased winter wheat yield by 3.0-6.0\% in northern part of the NCP, however reduced rainfed winter wheat yield by 9.0-12.0\% in southern part of the NCP. Decrease in solar radiation reduced wheat yield by 3.0-12.0\% across the,stations. The impact of precipitation change on winter wheat yield was slight because there were no pronounced trends in precipitation. Our findings highlight that modern cultivars and agronomic management contributed dominantly to yield increase in the past three decades, nevertheless the impacts of climate change were large enough in some areas to affect a significant portion of observed yield trends in the NCP.

This study evaluates the impact of 'global dimming' and climate change on wheat yield and water use in China during the past decades using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator. Three regions, Beijing, Chengdu and Urumqi were selected to represent three different patterns of climate-light environments in China. The decline in solar radiation was in conjunction with a warming trend during the past decades. Solar radiation during the wheat season declined by 20,27 and 10\% at Beijing, Chengdu and Urumqi, respectively, during the past four decades. Minimum temperature increased during the same period by 3.9, 1.5 and 2.3 degrees C, respectively. The reduction in solar radiation had no significant impact on simulated wheat yields in the Beijing region while simulated grain yields in the Chengdu region decreased by 32\%. Variation of solar radiation explained 74\% of changes in grain yield at Chengdu. Simulated grain yields in the Urumqi region increased by 24\% during the last decades due to increasing minimum temperature and rainfall. Simulated evapotranspiration declined with the decline of solar radiation. Water use efficiency increased at Beijing and Urumqi, with no significant change at Chengdu. Declining solar radiation from high radiation levels had no effect on wheat yield but improved water use efficiency, while under low radiation levels grain yields decreased significantly.

While previous studies have evaluated a range of impacts and adaptation of climate change (CC) on crop yield, few studies have focused on evaluating the effectiveness of changing cultivars with different vernalization requirements as an adaptation. In the present study, mean and inter-annual variability of yield were quantified for three winter wheat cultivar types at three ecological sites (Shangzhuang in Beijing, Quzhou in Hebei and Huangfanqu in Henan) in the North China Plain, by linking a crop model and the outputs of Providing Regional Climates for Impacts Studies (PRECIS) for both the baseline (1961-90) and future SRES scenarios A2 and B2 (2070-2100). The results showed that a warming trend prolonged the length of the vegetative growth period of local cultivars through reduced vernalization, generally leading to a negative impact on yield. However, the introduction of cultivars with relatively lower vernalization demands from warmer southern to cooler northern regions could be an effective adaptation strategy to offset the negative impact of climatic change. Adjustment in cultivars increased yield at Shangzhuang and maintained it at Quzhou and Huangfanqu. Elevated CO2 would significantly increase yield in the future with or without considering the sensitivities of the selected cultivars. The inter-annual variability of yield generally increased in the A2 scenario, but decreased in the B2 scenario. Overall, winter wheat with semi-winter types or weak-winter types would grow preferentially, while cultivars with winter types would probably be reduced in future.},

	abstract = {Northeast China (NEC) accounts for about 30\% of the nation's maize production in China. In the past three decades, maize yields in NEC have increased under changes in climate, cultivar selection and crop management. It is important to investigate the contribution of these changing factors to the historical yield increases to improve our understanding of how we can ensure increased yields in the future. In this study, we use phenology observations at six sites from 1981 to 2007 to detect trends in sowing dates and length of maize growing period, and then combine these observations with in situ temperature data to determine the trends of thermal time in the maize growing period, as a measure of changes in maize cultivars. The area in the vicinity of these six sites accounts for 30\% of NEC's total maize production. The agricultural production systems simulator, APSIM-Maize model, was used to separate the impacts of changes in climate, sowing dates and thermal time requirements on maize phenology and yields. In NEC, sowing dates trended earlier in four of six sites and maturity dates trended later by 4-21days. Therefore, the period from sowing to maturity ranged from 2 to 38days longer in 2007 than it was in 1981. Our results indicate that climate trends alone would have led to a negative impact on maize. However, results from the adaptation assessments indicate that earlier sowing dates increased yields by up to 4\%, and adoption of longer season cultivars caused a substantial increase in yield ranging from 13\% to 38\% over the past 27years. Therefore, earlier sowing dates and introduction of cultivars with higher thermal time requirements in NEC have overcome the negative effects of climate change and turned what would have otherwise been a loss into a significant increase in maize yield.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.agee.2011.11.005},
	abstract = {Nitrogen (N) lost from cropping is one of the major threats to the health of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in northern Australia, and there are government initiatives to change farming practices and reduce N losses from farms. Sugarcane is the dominant crop in most catchments draining into the GBR lagoon, especially those of the Mackay Whitsunday region (8400 km(2)) where sugarcane represents {\textgreater}99\% of cropping in the catchments, and is grown with large applications of N fertiliser. As farmers and farming systems adapt to a future requiring lower environmental impact, the question arises whether climate change may influence the effectiveness of these changes, an issue rarely considered in past water quality studies. To address this question we used the APSIM farming-systems model to investigate the complex interactions between a factorial of five proposed sugarcane management systems, three soil types, three sub-regional climatic locations and four climate change projections (weak, moderate and strong, with historical climate as a 'control'). These projections, developed from general circulation models and greenhouse gas emission scenarios, estimated that median annual rainfall would be reduced by up to 19\%, and maximum and minimum temperatures increased by up to 0.5 degrees C and 0.6 degrees C, respectively. Management practices, such as tillage, fallow management and N inputs, were grouped into five systems according to the perceived benefits to water quality. For example; Management System A grouped together zero tillage, soybean rotation crops, reduced N inputs and controlled traffic practices. While at the other end of the scale, System E included many severe tillage operations, bare fallows, high N inputs and conventional row spacing; practices that are still used in some areas. Importantly, this study parameterised controlled traffic systems, which is considered an important component of 'best' management in the GBR catchment, but for which water quality benefits have yet to be widely quantified. The study predicted that the improvement in farm management needed to meet water quality improvement goals will not be greatly affected by climate change. However, without any interventions, the frequency of years with very high N losses, and hence extreme ecological risk, was predicted to increase by up to 10-15\%. Compared with traditional practices, improved management systems were predicted to reduce N losses by up to 66\% during these years. The results support continued adoption of improved management systems to achieve proposed water quality targets in both the current and a range of potential future climates. However, there are important uncertainties about the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration on plant assimilation rates and the characterisation of extreme climate events that deserve further study.

We used a well-tested simulation model, APSIM-Sorghum, to evaluate the impact of temperatures +1 degrees C, +2 degrees C, +3 degrees C, +4 degrees C and +5 degrees C above current temperatures measured over the past similar to 50 years at four sites in eastern and southern Africa, namely, Katumani and Makindu in Kenya, Chitala in Malawi and Beitbridge in Zimbabwe, on the yield, aboveground biomass, transpiration and soil evaporation of short-, medium- and long-duration sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] cultivars given, 0, 20, 40, and 80 kg nitrogen (N) ha(-1). When fertilized with 80 kg N ha(-1), warming temperatures decreased average yields at Chitala and Beitbridge and yields were unchanged at Makindu and Katumani, but with no added fertilizer average yields increased with increase in temperature at all sites except the hottest and driest site, Beitbridge, where the simulated yields decreased with increasing temperature. Simulation of the changes in soil organic carbon showed that the higher temperatures increased the rate of loss of soil organic carbon and increased nitrogen uptake at all except the driest and hottest site. A micro-dose (20 kg N ha(-1)) of added nitrogen increased the simulated yields by an average of 19\% at Beitbridge, 36\% at Makindu, 59\% at Katumani and 72\% at Chitala, considerably greater than any increase from increased temperatures. The use of longer-duration cultivars and lower or higher populations could not consistently be used to overcome any reductions in yield from warming temperatures. We conclude that low-input, small-holder farmers will not immediately have reduced sorghum yields as a consequence of global warming, but micro-dosing with nitrogen fertilizer will significantly increase yields even in the hottest and driest locations.

	abstract = {The use of maize simulation models to determine the optimum plant population for rainfed environments allows the evaluation of plant populations over multiple years and locations at a lower cost than traditional field experimentation. However the APSIM maize model that has been used to conduct some of these 'virtual' experiments assumes that the maximum rate of soil water extraction by the crop root system is constant across plant populations. This untested assumption may cause grain yield to be overestimated in lower plant populations. A field experiment was conducted to determine whether maximum rates of water extraction vary with plant population, and the maximum rate of soil water extraction was estimated for three plant populations (2.4, 3.5 and 5.5 plants m(-2)) under water limited conditions. Maximum soil water extraction rates in the field experiment decreased linearly with plant population, and no difference was detected between plant populations for the crop lower limit of soil water extraction. Re-analysis of previous maize simulation experiments demonstrated that the use of inappropriately high extraction-rate parameters at low plant populations inflated predictions of grain yield, and could cause erroneous recommendations to be made for plant population. The results demonstrate the importance of validating crop simulation models across the range of intended treatments. (C) 2013 Elsevier E.V. All rights reserved.},

Here we show that the process-based Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) is able to reproduce both of these relationships in the Midwestern United States and provide insight into underlying mechanisms. The predominant effects of EDD in APSIM are associated with increased vapour pressure deficit, which contributes to water stress in two ways: by increasing demand for soil water to sustain a given rate of carbon assimilation, and by reducing future supply of soil water by raising transpiration rates. APSIM computes daily water stress as the ratio of water supply to demand, and during the critical month of July this ratio is three times more responsive to 2 degrees C warming than to a 20\% precipitation reduction. The results suggest a relatively minor role for direct heat stress on reproductive organs at present temperatures in this region. Effects of elevated CO2 on transpiration efficiency should reduce yield sensitivity to EDD in the coming decades, but at most by 25\%.},

	abstract = {Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an economically important legume crop in irrigated production areas of northern Australia. Although the potential pod yield of the crop in these areas is about 8 t ha(-1), most growers generally obtain around 5 t ha(-1), partly due to poor irrigation management. Better information and tools that are easy to use, accurate, and cost-effective are therefore needed to help local peanut growers improve irrigation management. This paper introduces a new web-based decision support system called AQUAMAN that was developed to assist Australian peanut growers schedule irrigations. It simulates the timing and depth of future irrigations by combining procedures from the food and agriculture organization (FAO) guidelines for irrigation scheduling (FAO-56) with those of the agricultural production systems simulator (APSIM) modeling framework. Here, we present a description of AQUAMAN and results of a series of activities (i.e., extension activities, case studies, and a survey) that were conducted to assess its level of acceptance among Australian peanut growers, obtain feedback for future improvements, and evaluate its performance. Application of the tool for scheduling irrigations of commercial peanut farms since its release in 2004-2005 has shown good acceptance by local peanuts growers and potential for significantly improving yield. Limited comparison with the farmer practice of matching the pan evaporation demand during rain-free periods in 2006-2007 and 2008-2009 suggested that AQUAMAN enabled irrigation water savings of up to 50\% and the realization of enhanced water and irrigation use efficiencies.},

	abstract = {This study simulated the economic and environmental performance of three types of wheat sown into soils with three initial N contents and using ten different fertiliser management strategies. The Agricultural Productions Systems Simulator (APSIM) was used to model crop yields for which gross margins were estimated and a Bayesian Network used to estimate environmental risk. Based on economic and environmental considerations, it would appear that for low N soils more than 10 kg N/ha is needed at sowing. For soils with medium to high N, short and medium season wheat varieties need only 10 kg N/ha, while long season varieties require {\textgreater}10 kg N/ha, at sowing. Additional N fertiliser can be applied after sowing to maximise gross margins, taking into account potential crop yield and seasonal conditions. Interestingly, the study suggests that where farmers increase their gross margins they are improving their environmental performance. This is counter intuitive as it implies N fertiliser applications can lessen N exports. This results from the enhanced water uptake by the crop outweighing the adverse effects of increased N availability. It would appear that flexible cropping systems that maximise crop potential with minimum sowing N, maximise both economic and environmental performance.

Two field trials were undertaken with alkaline and acidic fly ashes supplied at between 3 and 6 Mg ha1 to acidic soils and sown to wheat and canola at Richmond (Eastern Australia) and to wheat only at Merredin (Western Australia). Results Ash addition marginally (P{\textless} 0.10) raised the pH in the top soil layers at both sites. The exceptionally dry season at both sites constrained yields and thwarted any likelihood of gaining yield benefits from ash-induced improvements in soil conditions. Yield improvements due to ash addition were absent at Merredin and only marginal at Richmond, where no elevated accumulation of B, Mo, Se, P or S in either the straw or seeds of wheat was observed; canola increased accumulation of Mo and Se in its shoot with acidic fly ash, but it was well below phyto toxic levels. Simulations of wheat using APSIM at Richmond over a 100-year period (19092008) predicted yield increases in 52\% of years with addition of ash at 3.0 Mg ha1 compared with 24\% of years with addition of ash at 6.0 Mg ha1. The simulated yield increases did not exceed 40\% over the control with addition of 6 Mg ha1 ash, but was between 40\% and 50\% with an addition rate of 3 Mg ha1. Conclusion We found no evidence of phytotoxicity in either crop in this unusually dry year and there is still a need for further field assessment in years with favourable rainfall to enable development of clear recommendations on fly ash rates for optimum yield benefits.(c) 2012 Society of Chemical Industry},

	abstract = {Triticale and wheat are similar crops, but triticale represents a valuable alternative to wheat due to its greater biomass production and grain yield in Mediterranean-type growing conditions. However, despite the higher yield potential and increasing importance of this crop, there are no dynamic crop models available to assist triticale adaptation via simulation experiments. In a previous study, the APSIM-Nwheat model was parameterized for triticale resulting in a new APSIM-Triticale model but the new model was never compared with detailed experimental triticale data in a one-to-one comparison. Here, the new model was tested with detailed field experimental observations. APSIM-Triticale was able to reproduce phenology, biomass, grain yields and soil water dynamics. The model performed well over several years and management options that included different sowing densities, sowing dates and a short and tall cultivar. The tested model was then used to explore management options to maximize triticale yield across the Mediterranean Basin. The response to sowing density was cultivar and rainfall-environment dependent. The simulation analysis indicated that there was no yield advantage with higher sowing densities with a tall cultivar type in high yielding environments, despite its higher biomass growth rates. The highest yields were achieved at the early sowing date at the sowing densities between 100 and 300 plants/m(2) in the high rainfall regions for both short and the tall cultivars. The simulation study suggests that sowing a short cultivar with a reduced radiation use efficiency but early vigour growth could increase current yields across different regions, seasons and management options in the Mediterranean climate.

	abstract = {To feed a growing world population in the coming decades, agriculture must strive to reduce the gap between the yields that are currently achieved by farmers (Ya) and those potentially attainable in rainfed farming systems (Yw). The first step towards reducing yield gaps (Yg) is to obtain realistic estimates of their magnitude and their spatial and temporal variability. In this paper we describe a new yield gap assessment framework. The framework uses statistical yield and cropping area data, remotely sensed data, cropping system simulation and GIS mapping to calculate wheat yield gaps at scales from 1.1 km cells to regional. The framework includes ad hoc on-ground testing of the calculated yield gaps. This framework was applied to wheat in the Wimmera region of Victoria, Australia. Estimated Yg over the whole Wimmera region varied annually from 0.63 to 4.12 Mg ha(-1) with an average of 2.00 Mg ha-1. Expressed as a relative yield (Y-\%) the range was 263-77.9\% with an average of 52.7\%. Similarly large spatial variability was described in a Wimmera yield gap map. Such maps can be used to show where efforts to bridge the yield gap are likely to have the biggest impacts. Bridging the exploitable yield gap in the Wimmera region by increasing average Y-\% to 80\% would increase average annual wheat production from 1.09 M tonnes to 1.65 M tonnes. Model estimates of Yw and Yg were compared with data from crop yield contests, experimental variety trials, and on-farm water use and yields. These alternative approaches agreed well with the modelling results, indicating that the proposed framework provided a robust and widely applicable method of determining yield gaps. Its successful implementation requires that: (1) Ya as well as the area and geospatial distribution of wheat cropping are well defined; (2) there is a crop model with proven performance in the local agro-ecological zone; (3) daily weather and soil data (such as PAWC) required by crop models are available throughout the area; and (4) local agronomic best practice is well defined.

	abstract = {Rice field rats are an important pre-harvest pest of lowland irrigated rice farming systems in Vietnam. Farmers often apply traditional control measures too late for economic benefits to be achieved, due to the progressive inability of rice plants to compensate for damage. The use of computer simulation modelling was examined as a potential alternative approach to the management of rodents in lowland rice crop ecosystems. It was projected that 16 farmers who are involved in action learning cycles using crop simulation models to look at the relationship between timing and effectiveness of different control methods, would change their behaviour about rodent management, so that management is preventative rather than reactionary to pest damage. The study was conducted in three villages (2 treatment villages and 1 reference village) during the autumn-winter cropping season (July-November) in 2009, in An Giang Province in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. Effects of alternative rodent management practices were explored using APSIM modelling in a farmer participatory approach. The changes in rodent control practices of farmers before and after the involvement in the APSIM modelling approach are also discussed. The study showed that APSIM modelling adequately simulated actual yields at different rodent damage intensities, for the different growth stages of the rice crop. Pre-season yield predictions in response to rat management were the same for farmers' actual rice yields at the treatment and reference sites. The use of the modelling was an integral component of the learning cycle for farmers and extension workers in achieving a clear understanding of the rationale for changing their traditional rodent control strategies. Farmers subsequently changed the timing of rodent management to the tillering stage of crop development instead of later in crop growth after most damage has been done. It is believed that the model has the potential for application in other provinces of Vietnam with similar rice farming systems to those in the Mekong Delta. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

	doi = {10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2012.10.012},
	abstract = {The process of crop modelling to develop operational software requires different skills, from conceptualization of the biophysical system to computer programming, involving three main scientific disciplines: agronomy, mathematics, and software engineering. Model building implies transforming a conceptual model into sets of mathematical equations and then translating these equations into a computer program. Although recent crop modelling frameworks can technically support model building, the modelling process is not always well documented and difficult to repeat. The focus of this paper is therefore on developing and documenting an approach to re-assemble crop models, i.e. develop a new model from an existing one, using a crop modelling framework and crop physiological knowledge. Modifications to an initial crop model were classified according to three categories: (i) changes in parameter values, (ii) changes in equations, and (iii) changes in overall model structure. We illustrate the approach with a case study transforming a wheat crop model into a pea crop model. We discuss the role of each actor in the process to document diverse uncertainties related to the model (i.e. contextual situation, data, structure), and the general applicability of the approach for different crop modelling frameworks. We conclude that the use of our approach to re-assemble a crop model within a modelling framework facilitates integration of different disciplines around a modelling objective, and facilitates creating transparent and reproducible models.

	abstract = {The capability of the APSIM-Sugarcane model to simulate N management in the sugarcane farming system is well demonstrated for most Australian production areas. In particular, the APSIM-Sugarcane model has been used to investigate the impact of trash management on sugarcane yields and N dynamics, N leaching below the root zone and management options to reduce N losses and improve N fertiliser use efficiency. We used APSIM to gain a preliminary insight into the impact of natural climate variability on the N fertiliser requirements of sugarcane. APSIM was calibrated against a smallplot, N-rate field trial conducted at BSES Tully from 2004 to 2009. Next, the optimum amount of N required for each year of the trial that would produce 95\% of the maximum yield along with the grower and industry economic returns were calculated from the simulated and observed response curves for comparison to the recommended N rate for the site as determined by the SIX EASY STEPS N-management guidelines. Although the APSIM model provided indicative estimated sugarcane yields using the Tully trial data, problems were encountered with waterlogged conditions and when N rates were varied. The SIX EASY STEPS N guidelines did not grossly underestimate or overestimate N requirements compared to the optimal N rate for each year. However, fine tuning will improve the ability of this system to adapt to annual yield fluctuations caused by natural climatic variability. Options that may improve the ability of this system to better match N fertiliser inputs to crop requirements have been identified.},

	title = {What causes nitrous oxide emissions from some sugarcane crops to be so high?},
	abstract = {Nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas, and emission from soils in sugarcane crops of NSW are some of the highest measured from cropping systems. Yet, not all emissions are this large and the reason for the range is unclear. The high emissions come from a site with acid sulphate soils in Australia, and chemo-denitrification in the acid subsoils have been suggested as important causes of the high emissions. However, emissions from acid sulphate soils are not always at the upper end of this range suggesting the explanation is not general. We used the APSIM model to investigate the degree to which the biological nitrous oxide-generating pathways represented in the model might (1) account for the high emissions measured in some sugarcane crops grown on acid sulphate soils, and hence (2) provide a broader understanding of the basis for the wide range of emissions associated with sugarcane. We found conditions at the site where the highest emissions were measured, particularly a combination of high soil carbon ({\textasciitilde}10\%) and large applications of nitrogen fertiliser, gave simulated emissions similar to the high values measured. Sensitivity analyses showed that when soil carbon contents and/or nitrogen applications were lower, predicted emissions reduced to levels closer to those at other sites. Our results suggest that biological pathways are capable of producing the range of nitrous oxide emissions measured in sugarcane crops, and that the contribution of chemical pathways need not be great. The results have important implications for understanding both how nitrous oxide emissions from sugarcane may vary between different environments and how emissions can be mitigated; issues that are particularly important for the environmental sustainability of sugarcane production.},

	volume = {21},
	abstract = {Climate variability can induce uncertainty in yields, and threaten long term economic viability of rainfed agricultural enterprises in the absence of effective adaptation strategies. Enterprise mix diversification has been found to be an effective adaptation strategy for mitigating multiple sources of farm business risk in some contexts. The extent to which enterprise mix diversification can mitigate climate induced variability in long term net returns from rainfed agriculture is assessed in this paper. Building on APSIM modelling, the assessment applies Monte Carlo simulation, probability theory, and finance techniques, to assess the potential for enterprise mix diversification to mitigate climate-induced variability in long term economic returns from rainfed agriculture. Five alternative farm enterprise types comprising three non-diversified farm enterprises and two diversified farm enterprises consisting of a correlated mix of rainfed agricultural activities were considered. The decision to switch from a non-diversified agricultural enterprise with the highest expected return to a diversified agricultural enterprise consisting of a mix of agricultural enterprises was analysed. Correlation analysis showed that yields were not perfectly correlated (i.e. are less than 1) indicating that changes in climate variables cause non-proportional impacts on yields. Results show that whilst diversification can reduce the standard deviation of net returns by up to A\$122 ha -1 and increase the worst probable net loss by A\$99 ha -1, diversification can reduce the expected net returns by up to A\$96 ha -1 and reduce the maximum probable net gain by up to A\$602 ha -1. Further, under non-diversified enterprises, the likelihood of realising net losses higher than the maximum probable net loss under the diversified enterprise was estimated at up to 6\%. Conversely, under the non-diversified enterprise, the likelihood of realising net gains higher than the maximum probable net gain under diversified enterprises was estimated at up to 16\%.},

	doi = {10.1071/CP13237},
	abstract = {The majority of rain used by winter grain crops in the Mallee region of Victoria, Australia, falls during the cooler months of the year (April-October). However, rain falling during the summer fallow period (November-March) and stored as soil moisture contributes to grain yield. Strategies to better capture and store summer fallow rain include (i) retention of crop residues on the soil surface to improve water infiltration and evaporation; and (ii) chemical or mechanical control of summer fallow weeds to reduce transpiration. Despite the widespread adoption of no-till farming systems in the region, few published studies have considered the benefits of residue management during the summer fallow relative to weed control, and none quantify the impacts or identify the mechanisms by which summer fallow weeds influence subsequent crop yield. Over 3 years (2009-11), identical experiments on adjacent sand and clay soil types at Hopetoun in the southern Mallee were conducted to quantify the effect of residue management (standing, removed, or slashed) and summer fallow weed control (+/- chemical control) compared with cultivation on soil water and nitrogen (N) accumulation and subsequent crop yield. The presence of residue (2.4-5.8t/ha) had no effect on soil water accumulation and a small negative effect on grain yield on the clay soil in 2011. Controlling summer weeds (Heliotropium europaeum and volunteer crop species) increased soil water accumulation (mean 45mm) and mineral N (mean 45kg/ha) before sowing on both soil types in 2 years of the experiment with significant amounts of summer fallow rain (2010 and 2011). Control of summer weeds increased grain yield of canola by 0.6t/ha in 2010 and wheat by 1.4t/ha in 2011. Using the data from these experiments to parameterise the APSIM model, simulation of selected treatments using historical climate data (1958-2011) showed that an extra 40mm of stored soil water resulted in an average additional 0.4t/ha yield, most of which was achieved in dry growing seasons. An additional 40kg/ha N increased yield only in wetter growing seasons (mean 0.4t/ha on both soil types). The combination of extra water and N that was found experimentally to result from control of summer fallow weeds increased subsequent crop yield in all season types (mean 0.7t/ha on sand, 0.9t/ha on clay). The co-limitation of yield by water and N in the Mallee environment means that yield increases due to summer weed control (and thus returns on investment) are very reliable.},

	volume = {64},
	doi = {10.1071/CP13263},
	abstract = {Ecological studies often suggest that natural grasslands with high species diversity will grow more biomass and leach less nitrogen (N). If this diversity effect also applies to fertilised and irrigated pastures with controlled removal of herbage, it might be exploited to design pastures that can assist the dairy industry to maintain production while reducing N leaching losses. The purpose of this study was to test whether pasture mixtures with a high functional diversity in ryegrass traits will confer on the system higher water- and N-use efficiency. The hypothesis was tested using a process-based model in which pasture mixtures were created with varying levels of diversity in ryegrass traits likely to affect pasture growth. Those traits were: the winter- or summer-dominance of growth, the ability of the plant to intercept radiation at low pasture mass, and rooting depth. Pasture production, leaching and water- and N-use efficiency were simulated for management typical of a dairy pasture. We found that the performance of the diverse ryegrass-clover mixtures was more strongly associated with the performance of the individual components than with the diversity across the components. Diverse pasture mixtures may confer other benefits, e.g. pest or disease resistance and pasture persistence. The testing here was within a selection of ryegrasses, and the greater possible diversity across species may produce different effects. However, these results suggest that highly performing pastures under fertilised and irrigated grazed conditions are best constructed by selecting components that perform well individually than by deliberately introducing diversity between components.},

	volume = {29},
	abstract = {A significant warming of the regional climate with a 0.38°C.(10a) -1 rise in annual air temperature has occurred in Northeast China, which is one of the major agricultural production areas in China. It is essential to investigate the impact of climate change on the potential yield for spring maize, of which the total yield accounts for 30\% of the nation's production, and to demonstrate the contributions of new varieties to the yield increases. In this study, potential yields for different varieties of spring maize which was bred in different eras was analyzed, and the impacts of climate change on the potential yield of spring maize and the contributions of the spring maize varieties to the yield increases were analyzed. The APSIM-Maize model was calibrated and validated using the data obtained through field experiments in Lishu Jilin from 2010 to 2011. The validated model was then used to simulate potential yields for different varieties of spring maize. Guarantee rates and partial correlation analysis were introduced to analyze the impact of climate change on maize potential yield. Our results indicated, when the varieties did not change, the 50-year average potential yields of different spring maize varieties, which were bred in the 1960 s, 1970 s, 1980 s, 1990 s, and 2000 s are 7 879 kg/hm 2, 11 482 kg/hm -2, 12 148 kg/hm 2, 13 400 kg/hm 2, and 14 139 kg/hm respectively, and increase as the bred eras became later; the average potential yield from 1961 to 2010 was 11 537 kg/hm 2 when the varieties changed as new varieties bred. The potential yield decreased when the same hybrid was specified in APSIM for all years, if there were no changes of cultivation and management measures. Climate change showed a negative impact on the potential yield on maize, decreased by 22\%-26\%, and the decrease of the sunshine hour in the growing period is the main reason that led to a potential yield decline. However if the varieties change continually from 1961 to 2010, the potential yield showed an increasing trend, which indicated that the contributions of new varieties were 46.1\%-79.0\%. Therefore, the variety improvement of spring maize has compensated for the negative effect of climate change. The increases of the length of the growing period from blossom to maturity, aboveground biomass and harvest index of new varieties were beneficial to yield increases. Therefore, choosing good varieties with a longer growing period and optimizing the planting structure are important approaches to increasing production.},

The present review focuses on the factors mainly responsible for climate change and their adaptation and mitigation options using conventional and modern approaches. Since productive and sustainable agriculture sector might help to reduce poverty in the context of climate change because of dependence of maximum population on it. Therefore, to mitigate ill effects of climate change and to increase and maintain crop productivity, holistic approach needs to be selected by agriculture researcher. This includes development of stress tolerant genotypes together with sustainable crop and natural resources management with implementation of all these efforts by sound policies. Meanwhile increased temperature (2-4°C by 2100), rise in CO 2, droughts and floods might be frequent events of future therefore, emphasis needs to be on climate smart agriculture with the aim of reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) enhanced resilience and reduced wastes with the increase in the productivity of small and large scale farmers. The use of empirical, modeling and Niche-based approaches to design a decision support tools will be helpful. Meanwhile, development of resistance genotypes to biotic/abiotic stresses, choice of crops, change in the cropping patterns, rotation, time of planting and avoidance, nutrient use efficiency (NUE) and modern approaches like wide crosses, transgenesis or mutagenesis will be very helpful to achieve the goal of yield sustainability. Similarly, induction of C4 metabolism in C3 crops and increasing the specificity of RuBisco toward CO 2 will be another achievement. The techniques like introgression, amphiploids, induced genetic variation and bioinformatics (modeling and GIS) could be helpful to minimize the impact of climate change on agriculture system. Furthermore, simulation modeling technique was confirmed by considering case study of use of Agricultural Production System Simulator (APSIM) on management of agriculture system in rainfed area of world. The review would be useful for researcher, students and teachers working in the field of climate change and crop productions to recognize the use of modern approaches in the improvement of agricultural sector.},

The review also summarises the effects of low oxygen concentration in soil on rhizosphere processes, and discusses evidence for direct effects on plant physiology of reductions in soil oxygen caused by waterlogging. Finally, the review describes current crop growth, water use, and yield simulation models used in Australia (SWAGMAN, DRAINMOD, and APSIM) that incorporate waterlogging stress. It is suggested that there is scope for modifications to these models based on recent improved understanding of plant physiological responses to waterlogging and on further research.

The spring wheat yield was simulated using the APSIM (Agricultural Production System Simulator) model under various conditions. Quadratic polynomial regression, single factor marginal effect analysis and path analysis were used to investigate the response of spring wheat yield to changes in daily minimum and maximum temperature. The results showed that the biggest increase in spring wheat grain yield was 1.40\% (average of 1.34\%) when daily minimum temperature increased by 0.25°C with constant maximum temperature. Increase in minimum temperature had a positive effect on spring wheat yield. The biggest decrease in spring wheat grain yield was 2.88\% (average of 2.42\%) when daily maximum temperature increased by 0.25°C with constant minimum temperature. Increase in maximum temperature had a negative effect on spring wheat yield. The best fit curve between spring wheat yield and maximum temperature was quadratic parabola, which indicated a decreasing tendency with increasing maximum temperature. The synergetic effect between minimum and maximum temperature on spring wheat yield was negative. The negative effect of increased maximum temperature on spring wheat yield was greater than the positive effect of increased minimum temperature on spring wheat yield. Thus decrease in spring wheat grain yield was mainly due to increase in maximum temperature.},

In this perspective, current study was designed to analyze wheat crop as host to explore the dynamics of foliar blight Alternaria triticina and Drechslera sorokiniana under varying climatic conditions on wheat growth, development and productivity for Islamabad region of Pakistan by comparing and evaluating two modeling methods, i.e. Statistical (R model) and Dynamic (APSIM model). The impacts of fungal diseases on wheat yield under historical long term climatic data (1961-2012) and for forecasting of wheat crop under A2 scenarios (2100) were studied using farming system APSIM model. Efficiency of both models was evaluated using model validation skill scores including RMSE, d-stat and R-2. For statistical modeling, the values for pathogen occurrence for Alternaria leaf blight were with 50\% with d-stat 0.43 and RMSE 11.36 and for Drechslera leaf blight was 63\% with d-stat 0.75 and RMSE 8.81. For dynamic modeling, the values for pathogen occurrence for Alternaria leaf blight were with 97\% with d-stat 0.79 and RMSE 1.11 and for Drechslera leaf blight was 93\% with d-stat 0.80 and RMSE 1.40. The finding of the results led to the conclusion that dynamic model was more suitable and efficient to simulate wheat crop development and growth. As disease module is absent in dynamic model APSIM therefore future management options could be predicted by linking the future climate (2100) with host-pathogen interactions. Similarly, analysis of climatic scenarios that change over time might be performed in dynamic model. Consequently, it can be used further for decision making to mitigate the ill effects of climate extremes and design future management strategies based upon model outcomes. The results justified the significance of models as beneficial and necessary tools in management strategies and decision making processes and highlighted that both models might be used to predict disease occurrence and impact studies but dynamic model APSIM could be used more significantly with good validation skill scores than statistical modeling. This study is novel as there is no already published data/work regarding the modeling and simulation among the fungal diseases of wheat crop particularly from Pakistan.},

	volume = {5},
	abstract = {The model performance to simulate soil water dynamics was evaluated by comparing the predicted soil water content values with calculated soil water at different phenological stages of wheat and total soil available water using neutron probe. The pre-sowing soil water (mm) in this study varied from 40 to 50 mm in loam and sandy clay soil of Islamabad and Chakwal, respectively. When soil water is {\textgreater}50 mm, its effect on crop establishment is dependent on amount and temporal distribution of rainfall. Plant available soil water seems to be the most important factor if rainfall occurs between sowing and floral initiation period as happened during 2008-09 in the present study. The dynamics of soil water from emergence to maturity represented here as total soil water that remained maximum at earlier plant stages especially when crop roots were established and utilized soil water effectively that resulted in the lowest level of water at maturity which can be due to the evapotranspiration. The results depicted that the soil water distribution pattern mainly depends on soil properties and if sowing methodologies are resilient with available soil water then crop stand will be good and crop uses water much effectively. The results also depicted that when soil water is at drain upper limit (DUL) and the crop sown at proper time along with least soil evaporation, the soil water can be more easily taken up by the plant roots. Furthermore, the simulated soil water by the model was in close agreement with actual data. The validation skill scores like R2 confirmed the actuality of the model, therefore, dynamic model like Agricultural Production System Simulator (APSIM) could be used to describe the distribution of rainwater into different components like infiltration, runoff and drainage, and it can be used as a decision support tool for accurate management of different cultural operations for sustainable atmosphere-soil-plant (ASP) system.},

The goal was to find emulators that could fit simulation data and provide reliable predictions of new simulation output. Four types of statistical emulators were compared-linear models, non-linear models, linear splines and cubic splines-which varied in complexity due to the use of different functional forms to fit main effects and different methods to determine model parameters. Two methods of model validation were used to ensure that the emulator selected provided good fits to the initial simulation output and gave adequate predictions of future simulation output. We illustrated the various techniques of model development and validation using the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) plant growth model. The effects of rainfall amount, rainfall frequency, temperature and radiation on APSIM-generated biomass production of the perennial pasture species lucerne Medicago sativa were used as a case study. We conclude that, in this case, the best statistical emulator is the cubic spline. The novel approach illustrated here provides a rigorous, flexible and powerful means of developing and testing emulators for any complex simulation model.},

	title = {High-resolution continental scale modelling of {Australian} wheat yield; biophysical and management drivers},
	abstract = {Production of cereal crops in Australia occurs in a specific envelope of biophysical attributes leading to suitable and non-suitable regions for cereal production. The geographic extent that this envelope encompasses is vast and varied. However, understanding the optimal conditions can only really be achieved through spatially and agronomically detailed studies of local biophysical attributes. Computational limitations and data burdens have limited the scope and resolution of studies in the past. We employed high performance grid computing and parallel programming to operationalise the Agricultural Production Simulation model (APSIM). We then simulate wheat production potential over 110 years across 180,000,000ha of arable land in Australia and statistically evaluate the results to determine the key drivers. Analysis units were derived through a cluster evaluation of the primary climate and soil characteristics across an extended Australian cropping range. APSIM was used to generate simulated wheat production outputs for all locations over 110 years with 325 combinations of fertilization, tillage and residue treatments. Biophysical and management drivers were then examined for correlation using Spearman's Rho. Examinations of 3 management, 7 climate and 7 soil parameters (at 5 different soil depths) provided an indication of the strength and direction of each of these drivers on wheat yield. Based on the strength of the correlation, Nitrogen (N), Effective Rainfall in the Sowing to Harvest period (ER), Maximum Temperature in the Sowing to Harvest period (MTSH) and soil Water Holding Capacity (WHC) were found to be the key drivers of national scale wheat yield in Australia. Outputs were statistically validated against empirical data for similar fertilization, climate and soil characteristics in selected locations. Results indicate that crop production varies considerably in space, time and in response to management action. Of the biophysical factors used in the model, ER between sowing and harvest exhibited a strong positive correlation with yield. This parameter also expressed the strongest correlation in any direction, at 0.64. Accumulated rain also returned a strong positive correlation with yield although it was considered a similar parameter to ER. Additionally the MTSH exhibited the strongest negative correlation with yield (0.34). The length of the growing season also demonstrated a positive correlation with yield (0.32). Fertilizer application was by far the management driver with the strongest correlation with yield at (0.53) whilst both residue removal and residue incorporation expressed weak negative (-0.04) and positive (0.02) correlations with yield respectively. No soil parameters demonstrated strong correlations with yield at any depth in the soil profile. Results indicate that crop production varies considerably in space, time and in response to management action. Biophysical influences such as climate and soil exert an influence on yields with effective rainfall the key driver of production. An opportunity for farm managers to improve crop yields through careful management of fertilizer application in a small window where the marginal benefits of application change rapidly with other biophysical characteristics. These locations and timings require careful management so as to maximise yield without wasting resources. In all other times and locations the need for careful management is much less important as the relationships are largely unresponsive to one another. Like any study across large heterogeneous landscapes, considerable variations occur in the complex relationships between management and biophysical attributes. Understanding these complex relationships at a national scale is fundamental to sound future planning for issues of national importance such as climate change, soil carbon management and food security.},

	title = {Accuracy of root modeling and its potential impact on simulation of grain yield of wheat},
	abstract = {Accurate modeling of root biomass and root distribution of crop plants has become increasingly important to address issues related to carbon sequestration in soil and resource use efficiency of crops under different environmental and management conditions. However, the performance of crop models for simulating crop root system has been rarely tested in many environments due to lack of detailed data caused by the difficulty to measure roots. In this paper, we present detailed measurement data on root biomass and distribution in 0-200cm deep soil profile at key developmental stages of wheat crop at Wuqiao in the North China Plain, and compare them with the root dynamics simulated by the agricultural systems model APSIM. The objectives are to test the model performance for modeling root biomass and distribution, and to investigate the potential impact of errors in root modeling on simulated yield responses under different levels of water and nitrogen supplies through changes in irrigation and nitrogen applications. The data were collected in two field experiments carried out in the 2003-04 (Exp 1) and 2008-09 (Exp 2) winter wheat growing seasons, each with three irrigation treatments and one fertilizer-N application rate of 158 kg/ha (urea N). Irrigation scheduling included: no irrigation (W0), one time of irrigation (750m(3)ha(-1) = 75 mm each time) at jointing stage (W1), two times of irrigation at jointing and flowering stages (W2), three times of irrigation at upstanding (double ridges), booting and start of grain filling stages (W3) and four times of irrigation at upstanding (double ridges), jointing, flowering and start of grain filling stages (W4), all as flood irrigation. Irrigation treatments for Exp 1 were W0, W2 and W4, and for Exp 2 were W0, W1 and W3. All the experiments received 75 mm irrigation applied 5 days before sowing to ensure good emergence. In Exp 1 (2003-04), wheat root samples were collected using a drill (8cm in diameter) down to 200cm depth with a 20 cm interval before winter and at flowering and maturity time. In Exp 2 (2008-09), soil monoliths from a 20 cm (length) x 15 cm (width) area down to 200 cm were extracted, with 20 cm interval for the top two samples, and 40 cm interval for the samples at deeper depth. This was done five times: before winter, and at stages of upstanding, jointing, flowering and maturity. Roots were separated using double-layered sieves (1mm diameter) by washing out the soil with water. In addition, shoot biomass was also measured in each experiment. All plant samples were oven dried at 70 degrees C to constant weight to measure biomass. APSIM version 7.5 was used to simulate the root and shoot growth of the winter wheat crop against the experimental data. Compared to the measurements from field experiments, APSIM version 7.5 underestimated the rooting front advance and final rooting depth of winter wheat, but overestimated the root biomass and root shoot ratio at maturity by 100-200\%. The model also simulated simultaneous increase in both shoot and root biomass with increased irrigation supply, but measurements showed increase only in shoot biomass, not in root biomass. Correction to the simulations of rooting depth and root biomass based on the data led to little impact on simulated shoot biomass and grain yield under conditions of sufficient nitrogen supply, but higher simulated grain yield when nitrogen was deficient. Studies are needed to further investigate APSIM's ability to simulate root growth and its impact on biomass growth and carbon cycling in farming systems across different environments.},

	title = {Sensitivity analysis to investigate the factors controlling the effectiveness of a nitrification inhibitor in the soil},
	abstract = {Nitrification inhibitors have been proposed as an option to mitigate nitrogen (N) losses from farmland. One of these inhibitors, dicyandiamide (DCD), has been shown to significantly reduce N leaching and N2O emissions from nitrogen enriched soils with no adverse effects to the soil environment. However, the effectiveness of DCD in reducing N losses has been shown to be quite variable. We postulate this variability can be linked to the persistence of DCD in the soil layers where ammonium is located. DCD in soils will be subject to biodegradation and so the persistence of DCD in soils should be inversely proportional to microbial activity, for which temperature is a major driver. Furthermore, DCD is a neutral-charge compound and so should be highly mobile in soils and prone to leaching in direct proportion to rainfall. Thus, after application, the distribution of DCD in the soil profile over time can be affected by temperature, rainfall and the soil's drainage characteristics. We employed the simulation model APSIM with a recently-developed DCD module to analyse how the environmental conditions affect the processes governing the persistence of DCD in soils. The analyses involve data from simulations of typical pasture land in different locations across New Zealand with representative rainfall and temperature regimes and soil types. The simulations considered the application of DCD at different rates and in different seasons, over a 20 years period. Using sensitivity analysis techniques, we studied which processes play the greatest role in the disappearance of DCD. This led to recommendations for experimental protocols, including soil sampling, and data analysis which can be used to discern between leaching and degradation. The persistence of DCD was studied using the solutes' apparent half-life, that is, the time taken for the concentration of the solute to decrease to half of its initial concentration. We use the adjective 'apparent' because the reduction in concentration is a result of a combination of degradation and leaching rather than degradation alone. The results from the simulations with DCD were compared with those from simulations with the application of an inert tracer in which the apparent half-life is affected by leaching alone. Differences in the apparent persistence of DCD and tracer from the soil's top 20 cm layer were used to infer the relative effects of degradation and leaching. The results showed large variability for the values of apparent half-life of both solutes, but the variability was considerably smaller for DCD than for the tracer. The month of application and location (weather) were the two major factors driving the variations in apparent half-life of both solutes, with soil-type and some of the interactions between factors being secondary. However the order of relevance for the factors was different for DCD than for the tracer. Overall the influence of month of application in the apparent half-life of DCD was quite small, whereas it was the most important factor for the disappearance of the tracer. The difference between the apparent half-lives of the two solutes can be used to infer the effect of degradation on DCD persistence; the results show, therefore, that the month of application is very important for determining DCD degradation. The relative effects of leaching and degradation follow a clear seasonal pattern, in summer degradation is the major factor and leaching is of lesser importance, but in winter leaching is much more important than degradation. This offset seasonality for the two processes results in the low overall seasonality for the apparent half-life of DCD. It also emphasizes the challenge of distinguishing the relative importance of leaching and degradation for DCD persistence in the soil. To better determine the causes of variation in residence time of DCD, and thus its effectiveness, experiments should use a tracer applied alongside DCD.},

	title = {Uncertainty in modelled soil organic carbon changes under various cropping systems in {Australian} cropland},
	abstract = {Agricultural soils have been suggested to sequester soil organic carbon (SOC) through adopting conservation agricultural practices such as residue retention, no-till and increasing cropping complexity. At regional or continental scales, however, it is a significant challenge to quantify the changes in SOC stock and the corresponding uncertainty associated with variation of cropping systems and environmental conditions at high spatiotemporal resolution. Here, our aim was to predict changes in SOC stock after adopting different cropping systems under optimal management for sequestering soil carbon (i.e., no nutrient deficiency and 100\% residue retention) and quantify the relevant uncertainties at regional scale. Using the farming systems model APSIM, we simulated changes in SOC stocks for a 20-year period from 1990 to 2010 under a total of 59 cropping systems at 613 references sites across the Australian cereal-growing regions. These cropping systems were identified based on GRDC agro-ecological zones through expert consultation. To further understand the effects of cropping system in terms of carbon input on SOC dynamics, those cropping systems were divided into three categories to represent low-, medium-and high-input cropping systems in terms of carbon input. The simulation results indicated that, on average, the Australian agricultural soils could gain 0.19 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) under optimal management. However, the predicted change in SOC stocks had high variability among the three carbon-input categories. Generally, cropping systems with higher carbon input had higher efficiency for reducing SOC losses or enhancing SOC gains compared to lower carbon-input systems. For the same category of cropping system, its ability to reduce SOC losses or enhance SOC gains varied across difference GRDC zones. For example, in Qld Central zone where has higher temperature, the SOC experienced loss regardless of cropping system. In SA Vic High Rainfall zone where has lower temperature and higher rainfall, the SOC showed increase. This result indicated the importance of local soil and climate conditions to regulate the SOC dynamics under different cropping systems. A Monte Carlo approach was applied to assess the uncertainty induced by cropping system and scaling of point results to GRDC zone. Averaged across all representative cropping systems, the predicted mean SOC change was -0.1 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) with the 95\% confidence interval ranging from -0.22 to +0.007 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) in Qld Central. In NSW NW/Qld SW, the predicted SOC change was zero with the 95\% confidence interval ranging from -0.05 to +0.05 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). In other zones, the predicted SOC change was positive. In Vic High Rainfall zones, the SOC change reached the greatest increase of +0.44 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) with the 95\% confidence interval ranging from +0.22 to +0.66 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). In Western Australia, the predicted SOC change was generally positive across all representative cropping systems. There was significant difference between different cropping system categories. In general, cropping systems with higher carbon input could reduce the SOC losses or enhance SOC gains compared to cropping systems with lower carbon input. In three zones of Western Australia (WA Northern, WA Eastern and WA Central), however, the predicted average SOC change under high-input cropping systems was lower than that under medium-input cropping systems. We further calculated the contribution of cropping systems and scaling to overall uncertainty. The simulation indicated that the variability of cropping system accounted for similar to 30\% of the overall uncertainty. The greatest contribution of cropping system change to uncertainty in simulated SOC ({\textgreater}60\%) was observed in three GRDC zones, i.e., NSW NW/Qld SW, NSW NW/Qld SE, and WA Northern. Our results suggested that the uncertainty in scaling of point results to regional scale is dominant in the overall uncertainty. More detailed soil databases and information on cropping systems are needed for reliable prediction of SOC dynamics in agricultural soils at regional scale.},

	abstract = {Agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including nitrous oxide (N2O), are a major contributor to New Zealand's GHG emissions, and animal excreta deposited onto pastures are a main source of these emissions. Reducing these N2O emissions requires a better understanding of the factors driving emissions and evaluation of mitigation strategies. Computer simulation models can provide an effective tool for these tasks. We compared two process-based models, APSIM and NZ-DNDC, on results of three experiments on N2O emissions following urine application to the Horotiu soil in the Waikato region of New Zealand in various seasons and years. Soil ammonium and nitrate concentrations were also determined in the experiments. With default parameter settings, both models predicted the daily pattern of N2O emissions poorly (Figure 1) with negative model efficiencies. The sensitivity of various model parameters was examined: For APSIM these included the nitrification rate, the optimum soil temperature on nitrification, the fraction of nitrified N emitted as N2O, the denitrification rate, and the rainfall intensity. For DNDC they were microbial activity, nitrification rate, denitrification rate, plant growth, ammonia volatilisation, rainfall intensity, and fraction of N2O produced during nitrification were varied. Changing some of the default model parameters improved the model agreement in some cases; e.g. for APSIM when the fraction of nitrified nitrogen emitted as N2O was increased or the optimum temperature for nitrification was decreased, and for DNDC when microbial activity was decreased or volatilization increased. However, none of the parameters investigated could improve predicted emissions so that they agreed reasonably with all three datasets. A sensitivity analysis which includes more parameters and model functions, as well as changing various parameters simultaneously is needed. [GRAPHICS] .},

	title = {Modelling the response of {N}2O emission factor to nitrogen application rates and inter-annual climate variability},
	abstract = {Nitrous oxide is one of the primary greenhouse gases contributing to global warming, and its concentration in the atmosphere has increased significantly since 1970. Agricultural soils are regarded as the most important source for emissions nitrous oxide. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) put forward 1.0\% as the default country-specific value for emission factor (EF) for estimating country-specific direct nitrous oxide emissions from nitrogen input agriculture. However, the emission factor from soils is based on limited data. Large uncertainty had been found in the EF values as no allowance has been made for the effects of land cover, soil type, climatic conditions or management practices on the values. In this paper we use Agricultural Production Systems simulator (APSIM) to explore the response of EF to N fertilizer applications and climate variations. The model is used to predict emission factor following various N-fertilizer rates over a 120 years (1890-2010) in a semi-arid rain-fed wheat cropping system in New South Wales, Australia. Emission factors following N application to rain-fed wheat ranged from 0.13-0.23\%, which was significantly lower than the default emissions factor recommended by IPCC (EF=1.00\%). Our long-term simulation results clearly showed that EF increased linearly with N inputs, and there was a highly variable inter-annual climate. In the rain-fed wheat cropping system, highest EF occurred in years with medium rainfall years, which indicated that the proportion of N-fertilizer inputs loss as N2O emissions was not only highly impacts by annual rainfall amount but also rainfall pattern.},

	title = {Modelling to evaluate agricultural adaptation to climate change in southern {Australia}},
	abstract = {An important issue for Australian agriculture is the capacity to adapt to predicted climate change. The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2009) refers to adaptation as 'adjustment in natural and human systems in response to actual or expected climate stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities'. Conceptualizing and evaluating adaptation options in agricultural industries should be conducted at the farming systems level (Rickards et al. (2012), Hayman et al. (2012)) because it is at this level that management decisions are made and financial as well as natural resource impacts will be felt. In particular whole-farm analysis can represent purposeful, goal-seeking systems (Dillon 1976) to assess farmers' profitability and the system's sensitivity to risks such as climate variability and change. The potential of Australian dryland agricultural systems to adapt to climate change with perennial plants was assessed by Farquharson et al. (2013). Perennial plants have deeper rooting systems with improved access to soil moisture, making them better suited to warmer and drier climates. Climate data were generated using Global Circulation Models (GCMs) downscaled to specific locations and corrected for bias (Liu and Zuo 2012). The climate data were used to estimate growth and yield of grain crops, pastures, and an energy-tree crop using process models such as APSIM (McCown et al. (1996)) and GrassGro (Moore et al. (1997). Plant yield and production estimates and economic data (prices of inputs and commodities) were used in bio-economic models (MIDAS (Kingwell and Pannell 1987) and IMAGINE (Abadi and Cooper 2004)) to identify the most profitable land use and the cash flow of options available to growers. The general result was that adaptation to climate change using new perennial plants shows promise (at least in the short term) of maintaining the economic condition of these dryland farming systems. While simulation of future conditions is necessary to develop model parameters, we argue that to properly evaluate adaptation a constrained optimising approach is both necessary and sufficient. Adaptation of farm enterprises in a commercial farming system needs to account for the opportunity costs of alternative land uses. To accomplish this, it is necessary to develop bio-economic models with capacity for optimization. Linear Programming (LP) models were used which account for limited or constrained physical, biological and financial resources (e. g. labour, land, credit and time). With the objective function of profit maximization such models explicitly account for opportunity costs faced by decision makers (Paris 1991). The Marginal Value Product (MVP) of each farm activity is the value that the last few hectares contributes to the objective function, and is the basis for the revised farm plan that develops the adapted pattern of farm activities. The adapted farm plan is then used to conduct cash flow analysis which considers the likely risk (income variation) associated with future activities compared to the past. The use of constrained optimisation is the appropriate way to assess adaptation for purposeful decisions because it accounts for the opportunity costs of farming system decisions -this is the economic evaluation of adaptation. The analysis of farm system components in terms of cash flows considers financial aspects of adaptation. Modelling is essential in assessing future responses to changed external conditions, but constrained optimisation is additionally required to evaluate economic adaptation to climate change in future farming systems.},

	title = {Paddock scale modelling to assess effectiveness of agricultural management practice in improving water quality in the {Great} {Barrier} {Reef} {Catchments}},
	abstract = {Agriculture in the catchment areas adjacent to the World Heritage listed Great Barrier Reef (GBR) Marine Park generates pollutants that are a concern for the health of the Reef. Under the Paddock to Reef Integrated Monitoring, Modelling and Reporting program (P2R) of the Reef Plan, the impacts of improved agricultural management practices on water quality entering the GBR are modelled to evaluate the effectiveness of Government water quality improvement policies. The Source Catchments modelling framework estimates loads of pollutants entering the GBR lagoon from rivers. However, Source Catchments does not have the capacity to represent the collection of management practices available to farmers that affect water quality in runoff and drainage at a paddock scale. Therefore, paddock scale agricultural systems models were used to demonstrate the effects of management practice adoption and to provide input to the catchment scale models. Paddock scale models were used because they represent a level of process detail compatible with the management practice investments and implementation on-ground. A fit-for-purpose modelling approach was used, where the paddock model most suited to a given land use and/or water quality pollutant was applied. Three one-dimensional agricultural systems models were employed; HowLeaky in grains, APSIM in sugarcane with HowLeaky post-processing for herbicides and phosphorous and GRASP in grazing lands. These models share similar soil water balance, ground cover and runoff sub-models. However, they vary in the level of detail, particularly in terms of representing crop growth and in the processes considered, such as pesticide degradation and export. In grains and sugarcane cropping, the pollutant time-series (e.g. load per day per unit area) in the Source Catchments models was replaced with an output time-series from HowLeaky or APSIM for each soil-climate spatial combination. Management practices were grouped into systems classed as A, B, C or D. The proportion of each of these management systems contributing to the modelled loads was adjusted to reflect data on the prevalence of adoption of improved management practices in the GBR catchment. In grazing lands, GRASP pasture utilisation and ground cover time-series outputs were interrogated to derive relationships between changes in grazing system management and changes in the USLE C-factors. The USLE is used to predict hillslope erosion in the Source Catchments model. Scaling indices derived from GRASP outputs were used to adjust the USLE C-factors applied in Source Catchments where management practices had changed. The P2R program has demonstrated the effectiveness of linking paddock scale models or emergent models derived from them with catchment scale models. This has enabled detailed management options to be simulated to investigate broad scale water quality impacts of the adoption of improved agricultural practices.},

Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the ability of the Century, APSIM and NDICEA simulation models for predicting the decomposition and N mineralization of crop residues in the tropical Atlantic forest biome, Brazil. The simulation models were calibrated based on actual decomposition and N mineralization rates of three types of crop residues with different chemical and biochemical composition. The models were also validated for different pedo-climatic conditions and crop residues conditions. In general, the accuracy of decomposition and N mineralization improved after calibration. Overall RMSE values for the decomposition and N mineralization of the crop materials varied from 7.4 to 64.6 \% before models calibration compared to 3.7 to 16.3 \% after calibration. Therefore, adequate calibration of the models is indispensable for use them under humid tropical conditions. The NDICEA model generally outperformed the other models. However, the decomposition and N mineralization was not very accurate during the first 30 days of incubation, especially for easily decomposable crop residues. An additional model variable may be required to capture initial microbiological growth as affected by the moisture dynamics of the residues, as is the case in surface residues decomposition models.},

	abstract = {Under low input subsistence farming systems, increased pressure on land use and decreased fallow periods have led to a decline in soil productivity. The soils in sub-humid region of Ghana are generally poor and require mineral fertilizer to increase crop productivity. This paper presents the use of Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to simulate the long term influence of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) on maize (Zea mays L.) yield in Sub-humid Ghana. The APSIM model was evaluated at two sites in Ejura, on a rainfed experiment carried out on maize in 2008 major and minor seasons, under various nitrogen and phosphorus rates. The model was able to reproduce the response of maize to water, N and P, and hence simulated maize grain yields with a coefficient of correlation (R-2) of 0.90 and 0.88 for Obatanpa and Dorke cultivars, respectively. A 21-year long term simulation, with different rates of N and P mineral fertilizer application, revealed that moderate application of N (60 kg N ha(-1)) and 30 kg P ha(-1) improves both the long term average and the minimum yearly guaranteed yield. Variability in grain yield increased with increasing application of N fertilizer in both seasons. Treatments with P fertilizer application shows a similar trend for the major season and reverse trend for the minor season, thereby suggesting an interactive effect with rainfall amounts and distribution. Application of 30 kg P ha(-1) significantly increased the response to N. The response to mineral fertilizer (N and P) applications varied between seasons, suggesting the need to have a range of fertilizer recommendations to be applied based on seasonal weather forecast.},

	abstract = {Modular frameworks for crop modelling have evolved through simultaneous progress in crop science and software development but differences among these frameworks exist which are not well understood, resulting in potential misuse for crop modelling. In this paper we review differences and similarities among different developed frameworks and identify some implications for crop modelling. We consider three modelling frameworks currently used for crop modelling: CROSPAL (CROp Simulator: Picking and Assembling Libraries), APES (Agricultural Production and Externalities Simulator) and APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator). The frameworks are implemented differently and they provide more or less flexibility and guidance, to facilitate assembly of crop model from model components. We underline the importance of systematic approaches to facilitate the selection of appropriate model structure and derive suggestions to facilitate it. We particularly stress the need for better documentation of the underlying assumptions of the modules on simulated processes and on the criteria applied in the selection of these modules for a particular simulation objective. Such documentation should help to point out the sources of uncertainties associated with the development of crop models and to reinforce the role of the crop modeller as an intermediary between the software engineer, coding the modules, and the end users, agronomists or crop physiologists using the model for a specific objective. Finally, the key contributions of modelling frameworks in the crop modelling domain are discussed and we draw conclusions for the prospects of such frameworks in the crop modelling field which should continue to reside on the principles of systems analysis but combined with up-to-date advances in software engineering techniques.

	doi = {10.1016/j.agsy.2012.08.001},
	abstract = {Seasonal rainfall forecasts have been shown to have significant skill in many parts of the world. In this study, seasonal forecasts were used together with a crop simulation model and a simple pasture growth curve to inform several decisions on year-to-year farm management, including on land-allocations in a mixed wheat-sheep farming system. In seasons where "above-median" rainfall was forecast, N fertiliser applications in cropping were increased to support the higher grain yield potential, sheep stocking rates were increased to take advantage of higher pasture growth and unused pasture land was made available for cropping. In seasons where "below-median" rainfall was forecast. N fertiliser applications in cropping were reduced to minimise costs, and traditional conservative sheep stocking rates were used. Application of the Predictive Ocean Atmosphere Model for Australia (POAMA) seasonal rainfall forecast yielded additional profit of up to A\$66 ha(-1) per annum, equivalent to A\$200,000 y(-1) for an average size farm in Western Australia. The largest benefit from applying a forecast in wheat-sheep farms comes from the increase of more profitable cropping during "above-median" rainfall seasons. This is well above the benefit of previous single-commodity forecast applications, and therefore has widespread potential to improve decision making on mixed crop-livestock farms. With the projected decline of rainfall in the Australian and other rain-fed crop-livestock regions of the world, skilful seasonal forecasting systems will become increasingly valuable as they will assist farm managers to capture the benefits in the declining number of potentially high-production seasons and minimise the input costs in the increasing number of low-production seasons.

	abstract = {Field studies that address the production of lignocellulosic biomass as a source of renewable energy provide critical data for the development of bioenergy crop models. A literature survey revealed that 14 models have been used for simulating bioenergy crops including herbaceous and woody bioenergy crops, and for crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) crops. These models simulate field-scale production of biomass for switchgrass (ALMANAC, EPIC, and Agro-BGC), miscanthus (MISCANFOR, MISCANMOD, and WIMOVAC), sugarcane (APSIM, AUSCANE, and CANEGRO), and poplar and willow (SECRETS and 3PG). Two models are adaptations of dynamic global vegetation models and simulate biomass yields of miscanthus and sugarcane at regional scales (Agro-IBIS and LPJmL). Although it lacks the complexity of other bioenergy crop models, the environmental productivity index (EPI) is the only model used to estimate biomass production of CAM (Agave and Opuntia) plants. Except for the EPI model, all models include representations of leaf area dynamics, phenology, radiation interception and utilization, biomass production, and partitioning of biomass to roots and shoots. A few models simulate soil water, nutrient, and carbon cycle dynamics, making them especially useful for assessing the environmental consequences (e.g., erosion and nutrient losses) associated with the large-scale deployment of bioenergy crops. The rapid increase in use of models for energy crop simulation is encouraging; however, detailed information on the influence of climate, soils, and crop management practices on biomass production is scarce. Thus considerable work remains regarding the parameterization and validation of process-based models for bioenergy crops; generation and distribution of high-quality field data for model development and validation; and implementation of an integrated framework for efficient, high-resolution simulations of biomass production for use in planning sustainable bioenergy systems.},

	abstract = {Carbon sequestration in agricultural soil has been identified as a potential strategy to offset greenhouse gas emissions. Within the public debate, it has been claimed that provision of positive incentives for farmers to change their land management will result in substantial carbon sequestration in agricultural soils at a low carbon price. However, there is little information about the costs or benefits of carbon sequestration in agricultural soils to test these claims. In this study, the costeffectiveness of alternative land-use and land-management practices that can increase soil carbon sequestration is analysed by integrating biophysical modelling of carbon sequestration with wholefarm economic modelling. Results suggest that, for a case study model of a crop-livestock farm in the Western Australian wheatbelt, sequestering higher levels of soil carbon by changing rotations (to include longer pasture phases) incur considerable opportunity costs. Under current commodity prices, farmers would forego more than \$80 in profit for every additional tonne of CO2-e stored in soil, depending on their adoption of crop residue retention practices. This is much higher than the initial carbon price of \$23 t(-1) in Australia's recently legislated carbon tax. This analysis does not incorporate the possibility that greenhouse gas emissions may increase as a result of including longer pasture phases. Accounting for emissions may substantially reduce the potential for net carbon sequestration at low carbon prices. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, less information is available on how a wheat model performs in simulation of wheat. response to changes in varieties, sowing dates and planting densities across space. This study presents an evaluation of the APSIMWheat model using data from field experiments consisting of three sowing dates, two and three crop varieties and three planting densities in a split-split plot design at three ecological sites from 2008 to 2010 in the North China Plain. The results show that the APS1M-Wheat model could capture a large part of the variation in phenoloay, biomass and yield for the same variety across sites. However, errors of simulation in phenology and yield were increased with delay in sowing date, with the average absolute root mean square errors of 2 d, 3 d, and 3-4 d in phenology, and the normalized root mean square error (RMSEn) of 7-12 \%, 11-16 \%, 16-22 \% in yield at early, medium, and late sowing dates, respectively. Simulation of yield achieved poor results with decreased planting density, with average RMSEn of 9-12 \%, 11-12 \%, and 16-19 \% at high, medium, and low density, respectively. Additionally, the simulation behaved in a complex manner, and the errors varied greatly with different combinations of sowing dates and planting densities. These alerted us that the model should be used cautiously to simulate growth and yield over a wide range of sowing dates and planting densities. Improved modeling of the responses of wheat growth to extreme temperatures during winter and spring periods, and to varying planting densities is needed for better future prediction. Other areas of model improvements are also discussed.},

	abstract = {In Australia water stress is estimated to cost the sugar industry an average of \$260 million (AUD) per annum in lost production. With the predicted increased frequency of drought events the industry is now considering breeding for drought adaptation after water stress inflicted yield losses of more than \$400 million in the years 2002-2004, in one region alone. Defining drought adaptation broadly, including both short and long periods of water stress, we took the first step in improving sugarcane for such conditions by assessing the potential benefits of a number of traits in a simulation study. The APSIM-Sugarcane model was used to simulate the biomass yield response to traits that may confer adaptation to drought in a range of climates, some extremely dry at times, and in a shallow and a deep soil. Among the traits studied, increased rooting depth resulted in 0-21\% increase in mean dry biomass yield depending on the climate and soil type. This trait was more beneficial in the shallow than the deep soil which had a smaller fraction of additional stored water to offer the more vigorous root system. The simulations showed that breeding for reduced stomatal or root conductance (conductance) would increase biomass yield by about 5\% only in the driest climates and better soils. Other traits which conserved water such as leaf and stalk senescence were generally unsuccessful in conferring adaptation to the water-limited production environments considered. Simulations indicated that increased transpiration efficiency (TE) at the leaf level would nearly always help to improve sugarcane biomass yields in water-limited environments if the increased TE arose from up-regulation of intrinsic water use efficiency. However if increased TE was increased through reduced conductance, which effectively reduces VPD during transpiration, yields could be reduced in high rainfall climates and shallow soils and they could increase in moderate rainfall climates and deeper soils. Thus increased rooting depth, increased intrinsic water use efficiency and to a lesser extent, reduced conductance leading to increased TE, are suggested as the best traits to consider for selection of sugarcane clones in water-limited environments in the tropics and sub-tropics.

	abstract = {Rising nitrogen (N) fertiliser costs and concerns over environmental impacts have emphasized the need for rapid, non-destructive, paddock-scale tools to support optimal management of N fertiliser in cereal crops. Remote sensing of canopy reflectance is one approach to address the information needed to guide N applications. One remote sensing vegetation index, the Canopy Chlorophyll Content Index (CCCI) was developed to address issues of confounding effects of biomass and chlorophyll concentration, and Fitzgerald et al. (2010) linked the CCCI to the Canopy Nitrogen Index (CNI), a scaled index of the plant N. In the research presented here, we extend the work by Fitzgerald et al. (2010) and Cammarano et al. (2011) to whole paddocks with ground-based, airborne and satellite imagery. The methodology was applied to 11 datasets using multispectral cameras deployed on ground-based and airborne platforms, and to satellite imagery. The previously published relationship between CNI and CCCI was applied to the CCCI and biomass measurements from these new datasets to estimate CNI. Regression of the measured on estimated plant N values resulted in r(2) values for individual datasets ranging from 0 to 0.70. A regression using the means from each dataset produced an r(2) of 0.60, and a standard error of 0.82 (\%N). Exclusion of the airborne platform data increased the r(2) to 0.87 and reduced the standard error to 0.45 (\%N). A crop model (APSIM v7) was used to simulate above ground dry matter to substitute for measured biomass, and plant N was determined from the measured CCCI and simulated biomass. Regression of the measured on estimated plant N values resulted in r(2) values for individual datasets ranging from 0 to 0.49. The regression using the averages from each dataset was not significant (F-pr {\textgreater}0.10); however, exclusion of the airborne platform data increased the r(2) to 0.89 and reduced the standard error to 0.42 (\%N). To demonstrate the utility of the methods, simulated biomass values coupled with CNI estimated from RapidEye imagery were used to generate paddock maps of plant N. While the agreement between measured and estimated plant N at the paddock scales is not as close as the previous work done at small plot scales, the method shows promise, particularly if biomass can be estimated through modeling or non-destructive measures.

In particular, we examined the impact of a planned adaptation strategy to climate change -"Double-Delay" technology, i.e., delay both the sowing time of wheat and the harvesting time of maize, on both wheat and maize yield. The results show that improved crop varieties and management options not only compensated some negative impact of reduced crop growth period on crop yield due to the increase in temperature, they have contributed significantly to crop yield increase. The increase in temperature before over-wintering stage enabled late sowing of winter wheat and late harvesting of maize, leading to overall 4-6\% increase in total grain yield of the wheat-maize system. Increased use of farming machines and minimum tillage technology also shortened the time for field preparation from harvest time of summer maize to sowing time of winter wheat, which facilitated the later harvest of summer maize.},

	abstract = {Climate variability, and its increase with climate change, pose substantial economic risks to agriculturalists and hence, limit their ability to respond to global challenges such as food security. Enterprise mix diversification is the most common, and is widely regarded as the most effective, strategy for mitigating multiple sources of short-term economic risk to agricultural enterprises. However, assessments of enterprise mix diversification as a strategy for mitigating climate risks to ensure long term viability of agricultural enterprises are sparse. Using the Lower Murray region in southern Australia as a case study, we combined APSIM modelling with Monte Carlo simulation, probability theory, and finance techniques, to assess the extent to which enterprise mix diversification can mitigate climate-induced variability in long term net returns from rain-fed agriculture. We found that diversification can reduce the standard deviation by up to A\$200 ha(-1), or 52\% of mean net returns; increase the probability of breaking even by up to 20\%, and increase the mean of 10\% of worst probable annual net returns (Conditional Value at Risk) by up to A\$100 ha(-1). We conclude that enterprise mix diversification can also be an effective strategy for hedging against climate-induced economic risk for agriculturalists in marginal areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Simulation models of pasture growth. (DairyMod), crop yield (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator, APSIM), and dairy system management anti production (UDDER) were used in combination to investigate a range of forage options that may be capable of sustaining dairy business profitability under restricted water-allocation scenarios in northern Victoria, Australia. A total of 23 scenarios were simulated and compared with a base farm system (100\% of historical water allocations, grazed perennial ryegrass pasture with supplements; estimated operating surplus \$A.2,615/ha at a milk price of \$A4.14/kg of milk solids). Nine simulations explored the response of the base farm to changes in stocking rate or the implementation of a double cropping rotation on 30\% of farm area, or both. Five simulations explored the extreme scenario of dairying without any irrigation water. Two general responses to water restrictions were investigated in a further 9 simulations. Annual ryegrass grazed pasture, complemented by a double cropping rotation (maize grown in summer for silage, followed by either brassica forage crop and annual ryegrass for silage in winter and spring) on 30\% of farm area, led to an estimated operating surplus of \$A1746/ha at the same stocking rate as the base farm when calving was moved to autumn (instead of late winter, as in the base system). Estimated total irrigation water use was 2.7 ML/ha compared with 5.4 ML/ha for the base system. Summer-dormant perennial grass plus double cropping (30\% of farm area) lifted operating surplus by a further \$A100/ha if associated with autumn calving (estimated total irrigation water use 3.1 ML/ha). Large shifts in the forage base of dairy farms could sustain profitability in the face of lower, and fluctuating, water allocations. However, changes in other strategic management policies, notably calving date and stocking rate, would be required, and these systems would be more complex to manage. The adaptation scenarios that resulted in the highest estimated operating surplus were those where at least 10 t of pasture or crop DM was grazed directly by cows per hectare per year, resulting in grazed pasture intake of at least 2 t of DM/cow, and at least 60\% of all homegrown feed that was consumed was grazed directly.},

	abstract = {In recent years, nutrient management of soybean-wheat systems in central India has become a cause for concern because of stagnation of grain yields of soybean and wheat. The reduction in grain yield was mainly attributed to a suboptimal supply of nutrients to both the crops, use of poor quality farmyard manures and erratic distribution of rainfall during soybean's growing season and unavailability of irrigation water during wheat season. In this connection, the crop growth simulation models are handy in identifying the constraints to yield and recommending appropriate management practices to optimize the productivity of soybean-wheat system. To achieve this, the APSIM model was parameterized and validated for soybean and wheat crop of subtropical central India. Independent data set was used to parameterize soybean cultivar (JS 335) and wheat cultivar (Sujata) to be used for APSIM simulation. Genetic coefficient generated from this study was used for subsequent model validation. The data on water use, N uptake, grain yield and soil organic C from an ongoing long-term experiment was used for validation purpose. Three nutrient treatments, viz., control (no nutrient), inorganic (recommended rate) and FYM (8 t ha(-1) to soybean and 16 t ha(-1) to wheat) were used to validate the APSIM model. For organic treatments, we simulated N management using the FYM as the source of plant available N under field condition. The model was parameterized by specifying the N mineralized from the manure in the laboratory incubation. The model predicted successfully grain yield and N uptake under FYM treatments in soybean and wheat. For other treatments, model prediction was satisfactory in most of the cases in simulating water and organic carbon, grain yield and N uptake by both the crops. The discrepancy observed between the observed and predicted yield in the control under soybean was due to the P limiting condition of the treatment rather than the model. The predicted variability of crop yield was also due to the variation of weather during soybean growing season and amount of irrigation and N used during wheat growing season. Therefore, this APSIM simulation study can satisfactorily be used to make appropriate management decisions to provide farmers and others with alternative options for nutrient management for soybean-wheat cropping systems.

	doi = {10.1016/j.eja.2011.12.005},
	abstract = {Achievable grain yields can vary widely between seasons in rain-fed agriculture. Adjusting N fertiliser inputs according to achievable grain yields could reduce over-fertilisation in low-yielding seasons and allow increasing gross margins in potential high-yielding seasons. Seasonal rainfall forecasts from the coupled ocean-atmosphere global circulation model POAMA were skill tested and employed for N fertiliser decision making in the Western Australian wheat-belt. The POAMA seasonal rainfall forecast showed significant skill in forecasting rainfall season types in southern regions of the Western Australian wheat-belt. This skill resulted in about A\$50 ha(-1) of additional benefits when used in N management decisions in wheat cropping. However, such a forecast should not be used without considering other systems knowledge available to farmers. Combining a forecast with systems information such as initial soil water conditions can be crucial in obtaining value from a forecast. Another important factor to consider is the risk behaviour of farmers, where the gross margin from additional fertiliser is expected to exceed the cost by a factor of two or more. Finally, variations in fertiliser cost and wheat prices are critical in determining the benefits from using a forecast system for management decisions in agriculture. Using a forecast for only the wet season-type can further increase a forecast value because the additional gains in wet seasons are often higher than the savings from reduced fertiliser in dry seasons. It is expected that skilful seasonal forecasting systems will become increasingly valuable in regions where rainfall is decreasing because they help to capture benefits in the declining number of potentially high-yielding seasons and minimise the losses in the increasing number of low-yielding seasons.

	abstract = {The use of a fallow period to conserve rainfall as stored soil water is a long-established component of many dryland agricultural systems and there is general understanding that fallow management can play an important role in whole system water-use efficiency. Nevertheless there remain questions about the amount of residue required to make a difference and whether residue type or configuration matters. The magnitude of the observed effects on soil water accumulation has been variable, especially in short fallow systems. We present the results of field and lysimeter experiments of fallow management effects and extend these using simulation analyses to capture the impacts of climatic variability. The results allow identification of levels of evaporative demand and rainfall patterns that influence the effects of residue management and weed control. To move beyond whole-of-fallow, retrospective explanations of fallow management effects, we explain the results using a simple and easy to understand pulse paradigm approach adopted from the field of arid land ecology. Rainfall variability is viewed in terms of different possible sequences of rainfall events, which create pulses of soil water. By considering pulse size, frequency, duration and depth we explain the observed and simulated fallow management effects and provide a qualitative approach towards understanding and assessing soil water accumulation within the fallow period.

	abstract = {The variability of fresh water availability in arid and semi-arid countries poses a serious challenge to farmers to cope with when depending on irrigation for crop growing. This has shifted the focus onto improving irrigation management and water productivity (WP) through controlled deficit irrigation (DI). DI can be conceived as a strategy to deal with these challenges but more knowledge on risks and chances of this strategy is urgently needed. The availability of simulation models that can reliably predict crop yield under the influence of soil, atmosphere, irrigation, and agricultural management practices is a prerequisite for deriving reliable and effective deficit irrigation strategies. In this context, this article discusses the performance of the crop models CropWat, PILOTE, Daisy, and APSIM when being part of a stochastic simulation-based approach to improve WP by focusing primarily on the impact of climate variability. The stochastic framework consists of: (i) a weather generator for simulating regional impacts of climate variability; (ii) a tailor-made evolutionary optimization algorithm for optimal irrigation scheduling with limited water supply; and (iii) the above mentioned models for simulating water transport and crop growth in a sound manner. The results present stochastic crop water production functions (SCWPFs) that can be used as basic tools for assessing the impact on the risk for the potential yield due to water stress and climate variability. Example simulations from India, Malawi, France and Oman are presented and the suitability of these crop models to be employed in a framework for optimizing WP is evaluated.},

	abstract = {A 45\% reduction in riverine total nitrogen flux from the 1980-1996 time period is needed to meet water quality goals in the Mississippi Basin and Gulf of Mexico. This paper addresses the goal of reducing nitrogen in the Mississippi River through three objectives. First, the paper outlines an approach to the site-specific quantification of management effects on nitrogen loading from tile drained agriculture using a simulation model and expert review. Second, information about the net returns to farmers is integrated with the nitrogen loading information to assess the incentives to adopt alternative management systems. Third, the results are presented in a decision support framework that compares the rankings of management systems based on observed and simulated values for net returns and nitrogen loading. The specific question addressed is how information about the physical and biological processes at Iowa State University's Northeast Research Farm near Nashua, Iowa, could be applied over a large area to help farmers select management systems to reduce nitrogen loading in tile drained areas. Previous research has documented the parameterization and calibration of the RZWQM model at Nashua to simulate 35 management system effects on corn and soybean yields and N loading in tileflow from 1990 to 2003. As most management systems were studied for a 6 year period and in some cases weather had substantial impacts, a set of 30 alternative management systems were also simulated using a common 1974-2003 input climate dataset. To integrate an understanding of the economics of N management, we calculated net returns for all management systems using the DevTreks social budgeting tool. We ranked the 35 observed systems in the Facilitator decision support tool using N loading and net returns and found that rankings from simulated results were very similar to those from the observed results from both an onsite and offsite perspective. We analyzed the effects of tillage, crop rotation, cover crops, and N application method, timing, and amount for the 30 long term simulations on net returns and N loading. The primary contribution of this paper is an approach to creating a quality assured database of management effects on nitrogen loading and net returns for tile drained agriculture in the Mississippi Basin. Such a database would systematically extend data from intensively monitored agricultural fields to the larger area those fields represent. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Traditionally, the process-based agricultural models are designed for field scale studies that obtain inputs, run the simulations and provide outputs through the graphic interface. The graphic interface based model dose not suit for modelling practices requiring a large number of simulations. Here, we developed a high performance approach which concurrently executed the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) simulations using parallel programming techniques. In this approach, an APSIM simulation template with replaceable parameters was firstly designed, and new simulations based on the template was then constructed by dynamically replacing parameters of climate, soil and management options. We parallelized the batched running method in a shared-memory multiprocessor system using Python's Multiprocessing module. We tested the approach with a case study that simulated the productivity of continuous wheat cropping system during 20 years period along the Australian cereal-growing regions under management practices of 5 levels nitrogen application and 3 stubble management practices. More than 170 K runs were finished in 43h by using 64 workers, achieved a speedup ratio of 60.

Lucerne research into biophysical influences on plant growth and development has added flexibility to spring grazing management. Coupled with additional agronomic research and extension, farmers now have the confidence to use lucerne as a direct feed source for sheep, beef and deer. Research on Caucasian clover seedling development identified the long duration to secondary leaf production as the physiological basis for slow clover establishment in mixed swards. Despite agronomic strategies to overcome this, its use is now limited by commercial constraints. A 10-year 'MaxClover' grazing experiment at Lincoln University demonstrated the superiority of subterranean clover with cocksfoot over perennial ryegrass and white clover for pasture persistence, quality and animal performance. Pastures with high legume content had higher water-use efficiency and produced greater animal and pasture production. Balansa and gland clovers both show a strong influence of photoperiod on time of flowering, which suggests they may be suitable for oversowing into areas of winter wet and summer dry hill and high country. Further research into their ecological niche and ability to regenerate each autumn is required. For all legumes, the role of inoculation requires further research with recent results suggesting indigenous, rather than commercially introduced, bacterial populations are dominant in root nodules.

The impact of crop residue management on grain yield was lower under climate change weather conditions than under historical weather conditions. This can be attributed to higher soil moisture stress which also contributed to lower rate of soil carbon decomposition in the top soil. Instability (inter-annual standard deviation) in grain yield was higher under climate change (0.13 to 0.21) weather conditions than under historical (0.04 to 0.11) weather conditions. This was reflected in higher change in yield, thus, making sorghum production under rain-fed agriculture more risky, particularly to the smallholder (low input) farmers.},

	abstract = {In response to pronounced climate variations in Benin since the 1970s, adaptation strategies have emerged as the only alternative to reduce the vulnerability of rural populations. However, these announced saving strategies have been ineffective because of lack of initial assessment. The objective of this study is to determine farmers' adaptation strategies to climate variability and change that are the most effective and efficient for maize production in the highly vulnerable area of North Benin. Three farmers' adaptation strategies to climate change (change in crop variety, sowing date or seedling density) have been evaluated using the APSIM crop simulation model. Calibration and validation of the APSIM model on historical yields of improved local varieties of maize in Tanguieta district enabled to determine impacts of different local climate scenarios. From these studies of impacts, it is found that the scenarios with real risks of low yields for all maize varieties in Tanguieta are those of increased temperatures and decreased rainfall. The evaluation of selected adaptation farmer's methods to climate change under these scenarios enabled to recommend the adoption of improved maize short-cycle varieties; but the practice of late planting for both local and improved variety of maize and (2) the reduction of seedling density were not recommended.},

The future climate change is likely to present an additional challenge to the agricultural sector. Therefore, the effects of climate change on the current agronomic management practices were investigated using Same District, Tanzania as a case study area. APSIM software was used to investigate the response of maize ( Zea mays L.) yield to different agronomic management practices using current and future (2046-2065) climate data. The climate change projections data from global climate models were downscaled using self-organising maps technique. Under the conventional practices, results show that during long rainy season (from March to May) there is yield decline of 13\% for cultivar Situka, no change for cultivar Kito and increase of 10\% and 15\% for cultivars Sc401 and TMV1, respectively. Under the recommended practices, cultivars TMV1 and Sc401 are projected to register a 10\% yield increase whereas cultivars Situka and Kito are projected to register a decrease of 10\% and 45\%, respectively. Also, under both conventional and recommended management practices, results showed that during short rainy season (from October to December/January) all cultivars are projected to register between 75\% and 146\% increase in maize yields. This implies that future climate change is going to have positive effects on current management practices during short rainy seasons and it will have negligible impact during long rainy seasons.},

	abstract = {APSIM-Wheat model was validated in regional level with crop data from agrometeorological observation stations in North China. Combining the daily climatic data during 1961-2007, the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics were analyzed in potential yield, water-restricted yield, and water-nitrogen-restricted yield of winter wheat to understand the influences of climatic factors on potential yield in different levels. The APSIM-Wheat model was proved to be applicable in North China. In the region, the potential yields of winter wheat in different levels showed a zonal distribution in space with a generally temporal decline; however, the differences of spatial distribution characteristics were distinct among yield levels. The decreasing trends were from northeast to southwest in potential yield of winter wheat, from southeast to northwest in water restricted yield, and from west to east before a decreasing from east to west in water and nitrogen restricted yield, with the maximum values in lining, Shandong Province. Hebei Province was located in the zone of high values of potential yield and water and nitrogen restricted yield but low value of water restricted yield, where irrigation was the main factor to improve the yield of winter wheat. Shandong Province was in the zone of high values of potential yield and water restricted yield but low value of water and nitrogen restricted yield, where nitrogen fertilizer was the main factor to improve the yield of winter wheat. Henan Province was a zone of low value of potential yield, where radiation was a main restraint. The total radiation during the growing season was a major climatic factor that determined the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of the simulated potential yield of winter wheat, and it was positively correlated with the potential yield ( P{\textless}0.01). Precipitation during the growing season was the most important climatic factor for distribution characteristics of water restricted yield, which was positively correlated with water restricted yield ( P{\textless}0.01). In contrast, the variance of water and nitrogen restricted yield explained by climate factors was only 0.48, suggesting that soil factors were determinative rather than climatic factors. Under the background of changed climate and unchanged varieties of winter wheat, the potential yields at different levels showed declining trends which resulted from the decrease of radiation and the increase of accumulated temperature during wheat growing season. The primary climatic factors for determining the distribution characteristics of winter wheat yield were total radiation and precipitation.},

	abstract = {Canola is a major oil crop in the Yangtze River Basin of China, and its yield and oil content vary significantly from year to year due to changes in sowing time and inter-annual climate variability. However, there have been no studies to quantify the impacts of sowing time and climate variability. Experimental data to analyse the response of canola growth to sowing date are limited to a few seasons; however, combining these data with modelling provides an efficient means to study the impact of sowing date and historical climate variation. The APSIM-Canola model was calibrated and tested using data from three field experimental sites in the Yangtze River Basin. These experiments included different cultivars and sowing dates, and recorded major phenological stages, biomass, and grain yield. After calibration of the phenological parameters and maximum harvest index, the model was able to simulate the onset of phenological stages with different sowing dates, and to explain 75\% of the variation in biomass and yield caused by late sowings. However, the model overestimated canola yield under late sowing dates. The results revealed that canola yield declined linearly with late sowing time, mainly due to shortened vegetative growth stages, and varied significantly due to inter-annual climate variability. The yield potential at the study region is similar to 3 t/ha, on average. However, this potential cannot be achieved in the rice-canola double-cropping system due to later sowing time after rice harvest in mid-later October. Transplanting canola may still be an effective measure against the constraint of season length to achieving higher yields of both rice and canola.},

	abstract = {Objective: The objective of this study is to figure out the spatial-temporal characteristics of potential yield and yield gaps between different levels, and to explicit the constraints of spring maize production in the study region. Method: The well-calibrated and validated Agricultural Production Systems Simulator Model (APSIM) on a region scale was used to assess spring maize potential yields at different levels, and spatial-temporal characteristics of potential yield and yield gaps between different levels in Heilongjiang province from 1981-2010, based on the weather, phenology, management practices and soil data. Result: In the study area, the spatial distribution of maize potential yield was similar to sunshine hours in maize growing season, which was higher in west than in east. The potential yield of maize showed an inconsistent trend during the past 30 years. The distribution of rain-fed yield was similar to the precipitation during maize growing season, and showed a positive association with precipitation. The rain-fed yield was in the order of central {\textgreater} east {\textgreater} west. The rain-fed yield was lower and unstable in the region with lower precipitation. The rain-fed yield in 82\% of the selected stations showed a decreasing trend during the past 30 years. Instability of rain-fed yield was higher than potential yield. Qiqihaer and Suihua city showed lower values of climate-soil productivity. In the past 30 years, the yield gap caused by precipitation showed an increasing tendency, indicating the aggravated risk of drought. Conclusion: The precipitation is the key constraints factor on yield in the West of Heilongjiang province, and yield could be increased by irrigation, however precipitation is not the limiting factors on yield in Yichun, Tonghe and Mudanjiang, and yield could be increased by improving soil conditions, optimizing management practices. Yield can be increased by 16\%-22\% through improving the physical properties of soil under the rain-fed condition in Sanjiang Plain of the eastern Heilongjiang province.},

	shorttitle = {Living with less water},
	abstract = {This thesis presents details of investigations into on-farm adaptation options for rice farmers in Riverina in New South Wales and northern Victoria, Australia, using field experimentation, participatory engagement, and farming systems modelling. Additionally, a major component of this work was the development and testing of new modelling tools and decision-support structures. At the beginning of this research, all available models were lacking in at least some major element required for simulation of rice-based cropping systems. The capacity to simulate C and N dynamics during transitions between aerobic and anaerobic soil environments was added into the APSIM model, to facilitate our need to model farming system scenarios which involved flooded rice in rotation with other crops and pastures. Thorough testing against international datasets was subsequently conducted. Photosynthetic aquatic biomass (PAB - algae) is a significant source of organic carbon (C) in rice-based cropping systems. A portion of PAB is capable of fixing nitrogen (N), and is hence also a source of N for crops. To account for this phenomenon in long term studies of rice cropping systems, the APSIM model was modified to include new descriptions of biological and chemical processes responsible for loss and gain of C and N in rice floodwater. Using this improved APSIM model, together with participatory involvement of Riverina case-study farmers, it was demonstrated that the best on-farm cropping and irrigation strategies in years of high water availability were substantially different to those when water supplies were low. The strategies leading to greatest farm returns vary on a season-by-season basis, depending primarily on the water availability level. Significant improvements in average farm profits are possible by modifying irrigation strategies on a season-by-season basis. The opportunities for Riverina farmers to exploit their irrigation water resources also extend beyond the farm gate. Currently, there is considerable confusion amongst farmers on how to evaluate and compare on-farm and off-farm water options. In response to this confusion, a new conceptual framework was developed that enables quantitative comparisons between various options. The framework is based on a method regularly employed in the financial world for share portfolio analysis. Simulation modelling provided risk-return characteristics for on-farm options, and helped to elucidate circumstances under which off-farm options were viable. A modified version of alternate wet-and-dry water management for Australian rice-growing conditions (delayed continuous flooding, DCF) was investigated via a 2 year field experiment, aimed at reducing irrigation water requirement and increasing water productivity (WP). We demonstrated up to a 17\% increase in WP, and field data was generated on system performance for a range of discrete irrigation strategies. The APSIM model was then parameterized, calibrated and validated before being used to extrapolate findings from the two year experimental period to a much broader climatic record (55 years), allowing detailed investigation of optimal management strategies and a more realistic estimation of likely long-term gains in water productivity, and associated risks, from this new rice irrigation practice. Best practice guidelines were developed, and the potential impact of a changing climate on both optimal practice and likely benefits was assessed. This thesis concludes by synthesizing the approaches taken, addressing the question of whether improved rice irrigation practices, seasonally-flexible cropping and irrigation strategies and off-farm exploitation options, can in combination address the challenges of reduced irrigation water allocations in Australia's Riverina region. Evidence is presented that the answer is yes under certain circumstances, but that limits to change exist beyond which the investigated on-farm adaptations are not enough. The thesis also proposes that the concepts and methods developed during this project are globally applicable and useful in the design of farming system adaptation options.},

	abstract = {Rust (caused by Puccinia arachidis) and late leaf spot (LLS, caused by Mycosphaerella berkeleyi) can cause significant yield losses in Australian peanut crops. Until recently, all commercial peanut varieties were highly susceptible to these pathogens, but the new Australian cultivar Sutherland has significantly higher levels of resistance than the older cultivars. Field trials were conducted at two sites in Queensland to (a) confirm the improved resistance of cv. Sutherland over another commercial cultivar, Menzies, (b) study the effects of timing of first spray, spray interval and cultivar on disease severity and yield, and (c) develop a suitable fungicide management program for cv. Sutherland. In the 2006 and 2007 trials, rust and LLS developed slower and had lower final disease ratings and AUDPC values on unsprayed plots of cv. Sutherland than on cv. Menzies. The timing of the first spray is critical in managing both rust and late leaf spot, with the results demonstrating that the first fungicide spray on cv. Sutherland should be applied as soon as rust and LLS are first seen on cv. Menzies. In most trials spray intervals of 14 days or 21 days were suitable to effectively control rust and LLS. In years with low disease pressure, few, if any, fungicide applications will be needed to manage the diseases, but in other years up to four sprays may be necessary.},

	abstract = {The magnitude and timing of deep drainage and salt leaching through clay soils is a critical issue for dryland agriculture in semi-arid regions ({\textless} 500 mm yr(-1) rainfall, potential evapotranspiration {\textgreater} 2000 mm yr(-1)) such as parts of Australia's Murray-Darling Basin (MDB). In this rare study, hydrogeological measurements and estimations of the historic water balance of crops grown on overlying Grey Vertosols were combined to estimate the contribution of deep drainage below crop roots to recharge and salinization of shallow groundwater. Soil sampling at two sites on the alluvial flood plain of the Lower Namoi catchment revealed significant peaks in chloride concentrations at 0.8-1.2 m depth under perennial vegetation and at 2.0-2.5 m depth under continuous cropping indicating deep drainage and salt leaching since conversion to cropping. Total salt loads of 91-229 t ha(-1) NaCl equivalent were measured for perennial vegetation and cropping, with salinity to {\textgreater}= 10 m depth that was not detected by shallow soil surveys. Groundwater salinity varied spatially from 910 to 2430 mS m(-1) at 21 to 37 m depth (N = 5), whereas deeper groundwater was less saline (290 mS m(-1)) with use restricted to livestock and rural domestic supplies in this area. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) software package predicted deep drainage of 3.3-9.5 mm yr(-1) (0.7-2.1\% rainfall) based on site records of grain yields, rainfall, salt leaching and soil properties. Predicted deep drainage was highly episodic, dependent on rainfall and antecedent soil water content, and over a 39 yr period was restricted mainly to the record wet winter of 1998. During the study period, groundwater levels were unresponsive to major rainfall events (70 and 190 mm total), and most piezometers at about 18 m depth remained dry. In this area, at this time, recharge appears to be negligible due to low rainfall and large potential evapotranspiration, transient hydrological conditions after changes in land use and a thick clay dominated vadose zone. This is in contrast to regional groundwater modelling that assumes annual recharge of 0.5\% of rainfall. Importantly, it was found that leaching from episodic deep drainage could not cause discharge of saline groundwater in the area, since the water table was several meters below the incised river bed.},

	abstract = {Crop growth is driven by the capture and utilisation of solar radiation. The most productive crop sequences are those that maximise the interception and use of solar radiation. However, there are yield trade-offs because of the timing of transitions between successive crops. A longer duration of one crop will mean that the following crop is sown later and will therefore produce a lower yield. Maximising the yield of a sequence involves a compromise between the yields of successive crops. We describe a case study of a forage cropping rotation in New Zealand, demonstrating how simulation models can be used to define the best compromise between the yields of successive crops, and thereby maximise the total yield of the full sequence. A case study using a series of long-term simulation experiments for four diverse environments in New Zealand was undertaken in a continuous, summer maize - winter cereal, cropping sequence. Maize sowing dates and hybrid durations, and cereal sowing and harvest times were varied systematically. The actual simulated crop and sequence yields varied from site to site, but there was a consistent trend identifying the most productive combinations of sowing date and hybrid duration. The sequence of comparatively late sowing date of maize (1 December) and a long-season hybrid maximised the total yield of the sequence. The highest sequence yields were achieved by balancing the need to capture a high level of annual solar radiation and the need to have a large proportion of solar radiation captured by maize, which has the greater RUE in summer. This analysis illustrates how crop simulation models can be used to design and understand the processes that give the most productive cropping sequences. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N(2)O), one of the primary green house gases (GHG), is an important contributor to the radiative forcing and chemistry of the atmosphere. Nitrous oxide emissions from soil are mainly due to denitrification. In this paper, we test sub-modules in the APSIM and DAYCENT models to simulate denitrification. The models were tested by comparison of predicted and measured N(2)O emission from an incubation experiment using 8.2 L soil cores. The N gas sub-modules in DAYCENT were based on the leaky pipe metaphor, that is, total N gas emissions are proportional to N cycling and gas diffusivity in the soil determines the relative amounts of N gas species emitted. The same approach was added to APSIM to enable simulation of N(2)O emission. The soil monoliths were irrigated three times during a two-week period and set on tension tables to control the suction at the base of each core. The results show that APSIM underestimates denitrification, whereas DAYCENT better predicted N(2)O emission from denitrification. In contrast, predictions of CO(2) emissions were better from APSIM than DAYCENT. Modification to the temperature response for denitrification in APSIM improved the simulation significantly. The use of multiple soil layers in the simulations improved predictions, especially at low soil moisture content. Under these conditions, the layered approach better captures the impact of soil moisture distribution. Reducing the time step to hourly improve the prediction of N(2)O peaks and the daily total emissions, but there were still temporal mismatches between simulated and observed values. The denitrification algorithms in DAYCENT, combined with APSIM simulated CO(2), together with an hourly time step and a layered approach, produced the best results. These results highlight the need for improvement to the APSIM denitrification sub-model. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The model was evaluated for its ability to predict crop development, grain yield, biomass production over time, soil water dynamics. daily soil evaporation (Es), total evapotranspiration (ET) and water productivity (WPET kg ha(-1) mm(-1)), using two years of data from field experiments at Ludhiana, Punjab. The model predicted grain yield adequately, with coefficients of determination (r(2)) of 0.91 and 0.81 with and without mulch, respectively, and prediction of total biomass was even better, with r(2) of 0.99 and 0.92. The corresponding absolute RMSE values were 433 and 550 kg ha(-1) for grain yield (means 4100 and 3800 kg ha(-1)) and 300 and 800 kg ha(-1) for total biomass (means 10,200 and 9300 kg ha(-1)). However, grain yield was underpredicted (by 600-1000 kg ha(-1)) in treatments where the crop was subjected to water deficit stress, even though simulation of soil water dynamics, and the effect mulch on soil water content, was generally very good. The model accurately predicted total crop seasonal evaporation and the effect of mulch; however, daily Es was poorly simulated. APSIM does not attempt to capture the soil temperature driven effect of mulch on crop phenology. The evaluation shows that APSIM is suitable to use for wheat under the conditions of north-west India. However, additional model processes that capture the effects of mulch on crop development and growth, as driven by soil temperature, are needed to help design intensive cropping systems to optimise land and water productivity. The ability to better simulate crop performance under conditions of water deficit is also needed to help determine irrigation management strategies that minimise irrigation input while maintaining yield.

	abstract = {A combination of high input management systems, high annual rainfall and deep, permeable soils in northern Tasmania create conditions that are conducive to high drainage and nitrogen losses below the root zone. An understanding of the extent and mechanism of such losses will enable farm managers and their consultants to identify and implement more sustainable management practices that minimise potential adverse financial and environmental consequences. Analysing the fate of water and nutrients in farming systems is complex and influenced by a wide range of factors including management, soil characteristics, seasonal climate variability and management history of the paddock/farm in question. This paper describes a novel farm system modelling approach based on the model APSIM, for analysing the fate of nitrogen and water in mixed vegetable-based farming enterprises. The study was based on seven case farms across the Panatana catchment in northern Tasmania. Substantial simulated drainage losses ({\textgreater}100 mm average seasonal loss) were apparent for all crop and rotation elements across all farms in response to the surplus between crop water supply and crop water use. Crop nitrogen demand was found to be close to crop nitrogen supply for all crop and pasture rotation elements with the exception of potato, which had an average surplus nitrogen supply of 89 kg N/ha. This resulted in potato having much higher nitrate nitrogen leaching losses (32 kg N/ha) compared to other crops ({\textless}10 kg N/ha). Simulations suggest that practicable management options such as deficit-based irrigation and reduced N fertiliser rates will maintain current levels of productivity while reducing potential offsite N loss and generating significant financial savings via reduced input costs.

Water deficits are one environmental factor that can influence crop phenology through shortening or lengthening the developmental phase, yet the phenological responses to water deficits have rarely been quantified. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of a decision support technology software tool, PhenologyMMS V1.2, developed to simulate the phenology of various crops for varying levels of soil water. The program is intended to be simple to use, requires minimal information for calibration, and can be incorporated into other crop simulation models. It consists of a Java interface connected to FORTRAN science modules to simulate phenological responses. The complete developmental sequence of the shoot apex correlated with phenological events, and the response to soil water availability for winter and spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L), winter and spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), corn (Zen mays L), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), proso millet (Panicum milaceum L), hay/foxtail millet [Seraria italica (L) P. Beauv.], and sunflower (Helianthus annus L) were created based on experimental data and the literature. Model evaluation consisted of testing algorithms using "generic" default phenology parameters for wheat (i.e., no calibration for specific cultivars was used) for a variety of field experiments to predict developmental events. Results demonstrated that the program has general applicability for predicting crop phenology and can aid in crop management. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Geo-referenced information on crop production that is both spatially- and temporally-dense would be useful for management in precision agriculture (PA). Crop yield monitors provide spatially but not temporally dense information. Crop growth simulation modelling can provide temporal density, but traditionally fail on the spatial issue. The research described was motivated by the challenge of satisfying both the spatial and temporal data needs of PA. The methods presented depart from current crop modelling within PA by introducing meta-modelling in combination with inverse modelling to estimate site-specific soil properties. The soil properties are used to predict spatially- and temporally-dense crop yields. An inverse meta-model was derived from the agricultural production simulator (APSIM) using neural networks to estimate soil available water capacity (AWC) from available yield data. Maps of AWC with a resolution of 10 m were produced across a dryland grain farm in Australia. For certain years and fields, the estimates were useful for yield prediction with APSIM and multiple regression, whereas for others the results were disappointing. The estimates contain 'implicit information' about climate interactions with soil, crop and landscape that needs to be identified. Improvement of the meta-model with more AWC scenarios, more years of yield data, inclusion of additional variables and accounting for uncertainty are discussed. We concluded that it is worthwhile to pursue this approach as an efficient way of extracting soil physical information that exists within crop yield maps to create spatially- and temporally-dense datasets.},

The models' default settings overestimated the decomposition and N-mineralization of plant residues, underlining the fact that the models must be calibrated for use under tropical conditions. For example, the APSIM model simulated the decomposition of the Stizolobium aterrimum and Calopogonium mucunoides residues with an error rate of 37.62 and 48.23 \%, respectively, by comparison with the observed data, and was the least accurate model in the absence of calibration. At the default settings, the NDICEA model produced an error rate of 10.46 and 14.46 \% and the CENTURY model, 21.42 and 31.84 \%, respectively, for Stizolobium aterrimum and Calopogonium mucunoides residue decomposition. After calibration, the models showed a :high level of accuracy in estimating decomposition and N- mineralization, with an error rate of less than 20 \%. The calibrated NDICEA model showed the highest level of accuracy, followed by the APSIM and CENTURY. All models performed poorly in the first few months of decomposition and N-mineralization, indicating the need of an additional parameter for initial microorganism growth on the residues that would take the effect of leaching clue to rainfall into account.},

	abstract = {Increased subsoil water extraction by wheat roots enhanced through management or breeding can increase yield, but the benefits depend on the seasonal pattern of water availability as influenced by rainfall distribution, soil type and management. We used a well validated crop simulation model to assess the wheat yield benefits arising from 20\% faster root descent and/or more effective water extraction in the subsoil ({\textgreater}0.6 m) under different management scenarios. The analysis was conducted in Mediterranean, temperate equi-seasonal and subtropical Australian wheat-growing environments on deep sand, loam and deep clay soils, respectively. Overall mean yield benefits 01 0.3-0.4 t ha(-1) were predicted from the combination of faster descent and more efficient roots at all sites and yield reductions were rare, although considerable seasonal and site variation in yield benefits was evident (range in benefits -0.1 to 1.4 t ha(-1)). In general, faster root descent provided less separate benefit to water uptake and yield (up to 9 mm and 0.1 t ha(-1)) than more efficient subsoil extraction (up to 21 mm and 0.3 t ha(-1)), especially for optimal sowing dates, although late-sown crops on deep sands were an exception. At all sites, the yield impacts of preceding management (0.5 to 1.8 t ha(-1)) and sowing date (0.1 to 0.9 t ha(-1)) were more consistent and often exceeded or overrode those of root modification by influencing the depth of profile wetting and duration of root descent. For example there was little benefit ({\textless}0.1 t ha(-1)) of modified roots following lucerne compared to an annual crop at most sites as the soils rewet below 1 m less frequently. The study provides insights for targeting those environments and management scenarios for which the largest yield benefits will arise from investments to improve wheat root systems.

	volume = {113},
	doi = {10.1016/j.still.2011.02.003},
	abstract = {Soil damage by livestock on cropped land is a concern for mixed crop-livestock producers. The hypothesis that livestock-induced soil damage does not effect subsequent crop productivity was investigated in three ways; a review of existing literature; two experimental studies in southern Australia; and based on these, use of a farming system model to simulate likely consequences of changes to soil conditions on crop productivity under a variety of seasonal conditions. The literature suggests that treading by livestock increases soil strength and bulk density and reduces macro-porosity and infiltration rate. Yet, the effects are confined to the soil surface (0-0.1 m) and are short-lived due to amelioration through natural processes or tillage. Despite the potential for soil damage, few studies report yield penalties in following crops, possibly because effects are too small in magnitude or depth to influence plant growth significantly, or because of the highly season-dependent nature of crop response. Two recent field experiments in southern Australia also found no effect of sheep grazing on subsequent crop grow :h or yield, despite evidence of surface compaction and reduced infiltration rate. Using reviewed literature and this experimental evidence, we adjusted soil parameters in APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator) to reflect mild, moderate and severe reductions in surface root growth and surface water infiltration. The predicted sensitivity of wheat crop productivity to these simulated impacts was investigated at 6 locations in eastern Australia. Consistent with experimental evidence, predicted average grain yield was reduced by {\textless}10\% (+3 to -10\%) under mild and moderate scenarios typical of those reported experimentally. Crop yields were reduced by lower rainfall infiltration and fallow efficiency in locations with summer-dominant-rainfall, and by reduced root exploration at locations with winter-dominant-rainfall. Lower residue cover levels amplified reductions in rainfall infiltration, especially reducing the accumulation of soil water during summer fallow. Predicted grain yield was only reduced substantially (up to 43\% on average) when severe changes in soil parameters were implemented (e.g 90\% reduction in rate of root exploration in surface layers). Overall, most experiments support our hypothesis that grazing livestock have little effect on subsequent crop yields. Long-term simulations suggest that soil impacts generating large reductions in root growth and infiltration rate are required to reduce subsequent crop yields substantially. Such impacts are unlikely where current best-practice grazing management occurs, but would be possible on structurally degraded soils where surface cover is allowed to fall below critical levels.

	abstract = {In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), rainfed agriculture is the dominant source of food production. Over the past 50 years much agronomic crop research has been undertaken, and the results of such work are used in formulating recommendations for farmers. However, since rainfall is highly variable across seasons the outcomes of such research will depend upon the rainfall characteristics of the seasons during which the work was undertaken. A major constraint that is laced by such research is die length of time for which studies could be continued, typically ranging between three and live years. This begs the question as to what extent the research was able to 'sample' the natural longer-term season-to-season rainfall variability Without knowledge of the full implications of weather variability on the performance of innovations being recommended, farmers cannot be properly advised about the possible weather-induced risks that they may face over time. To overcome this constraint, crop growth simulation models such as the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) can be used as an integral part of field-based agronomic studies. When driven) by long-term daily weather data (30+ years), such models can provide weather-induced risk estimates for a wide range of crop, soil and water management innovations for the major rainfed crops of SSA. Where access to long-term weather data is not possible, weather generators such as MarkSim can be used. This study demonstrates the value of such tools in climate risk analyses and assesses the value of the outputs in the context of a high potential maize production area in Kenya. MarkSim generated weather data is shown to provide a satisfactory approximation of recorded weather data at hand, and the output of 50 years of APSIM si 1 simulations demonstrate maize yield responses to plant population, weed control and nitrogen (N) fertilizer use that correspond well with results reported in the literature. Weather-induced risk is shown to have important effects on the rates of return (\$ per \$ invested) to N-fertilizer use which, across seasons and rates of N-application, ranged from 1.1 to 6.2. Similarly, rates of return to weed control and to planting at contrasting populations were also affected by seasonal variations in weather but were always so high as to not constitute a risk for small-scale 1,farmers. An analysis investigating the relative importance or temperature, radiation and water availability in contributing to weather-induced risk at different maize growth stages corresponded well with crop physiological studies reported in the literature.},

Precision agriculture has the potential to increase crop productivity thorough tailored agricultural practices for different growing areas. Many models of crops and agro-ecosystems capable of predicting interaction between plants and environments have been developed for precision agriculture. Currently, there are several representative categories of crop and agro-ecosystem models, including the de Wit school models, the DSSAT series models and the APSIM series models, which have contributed substantially to improvement of agricultural practices. However, these models are weak in predicting performances of crops under environmental and genetic perturbations are generally weak, which severely limits the application of these models in guiding precision agriculture. We need to develop the next generation crop and agro-ecosystems models with a high level of mechanistic basis, which can be integrated with high throughput data and can predict the heterogeneity of environmental factors inside canopy and dynamic canopy photosynthesis. In developing such a model close collaboration is inevitably required among scientists from different disciplines. The successful development and application of such models will undoubtedly advance precision agriculture through providing better agronomical practices tailored for different growing environments. These models will also form a basis to identify breeding targets for increased productivity at given location with given soil and climatic conditions.},

	abstract = {The rainfall pattern in the Sahel is very erratic with a high spatial variability. We tested the often reported hypothesis that the dispersion of farmers' fields around the village territory helps mitigate agro-climatic risk by increasing yield stability from year to year. We also wished to evaluate whether this strategy had an effect on the yield disparity among households in a village. Based on a network of approximately 60 rain gauges spread over 500 km(2) in the Fakara region (Southwest Niger), daily rainfall was interpolated at 300 m x 300 m resolution over a 12-year period. This data was used to compute, by means of the APSIM crop simulation model, millet biomass and grain yields at the pixel scale. Simulated yields were combined with the land tenure map of the Banizoumbou village in a GIS to assess millet yield at field and household level. Agro-climatic risk analysis was performed using linear regression between a spatial dispersion index of household fields and the inter-annual (instability) and inter-household (disparity) millet yield variability of 107 households in the village territory. We find that the spatial variability of annual rainfall induces an even higher spatial variability of millet production at pixel, field and household levels. The dispersion of farm fields reduces moderately but significantly the disparity of millet yield between households each year and increases the inter-annual yield stability of a given household. The less the household fields are scattered, the more the presence of a fertility gradient around the village enhances the inter-annual stability but also the disparity between households. Our results provide evidence that field dispersion is an effective strategy to mitigate agro-climatic risk, as claimed by farmers in the Sahelian Niger. Although the results should be confirmed by further research on longer term rainfall spatial data, it is clearly advisable that any land reforms in the area take into account the benefits of field dispersion to mitigate climatic risk.

	abstract = {Predicting N mineralization from organic manures like farmyard manure (FYM) is more difficult than from fresh organic materials like crop residues, as the manures vary greatly in composition. A laboratory incubation experiment was carried out for 98 days at 30 degrees C under aerobic conditions to study the effects on N dynamics of Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium, Jacquin) and FYM application to soil at 5 and 10 g kg(-1). Application of Gliricidia induced N mineralization from the start of incubation period, with the amount of N mineralized increasing with rate of application. In contrast, application of FYM resulted in immobilization of mineral N in soil, irrespective of the rate of application. The initial net immobilization from FYM was limited by availability of N in the soil for the higher rate of application. We used the APSIM SoilN module to simulate these contrasting patterns of mineralization of N from Gliricidia and from FYM. The prediction of N mineralized from Gliricidia was better than FYM. The default model parameters specify that the fresh organic matter pools (FPOOL1. FPOOL2 and FPOOL3) have the same C:N ratio and this assumption was ineffective in predicting N mineralized from FYM. The predictive ability of the model improved when this default assumption was modified based on the size of the individual pools (FPOOL1, FPOOL2 and FPOOL3), and the pool's C:N ratios. The modelling efficiency, a measure of goodness of fit between the simulated and observed data, improved markedly for the modified model. The discrepancy between the modelled and observed data was a tendency for the model to underestimate the rate of re-mineralization at the lower rate of application of FYM in the later part of incubation. Unfortunately the appropriate modification to the size and C:N ratios of the FPOOLs could not be determined on the basis of chemical analysis alone. Thus, a true predictive application of the model to a new FYM material is not yet possible. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We illustrate the use of the framework, and its place in a larger research programme, by employing it to synthesise the results from a set of modelling analyses of the effect of land use choices on long-term productivity and a range of NRM indicators (frequency of low ground cover, deep drainage, N leaching rates and rate of change in surface soil organic carbon). The analyses span scales from single paddocks and years to whole farms and have been carried out with the APSIM and GRAZPLAN biophysical simulation models and the MIDAS whole-farm economic model. In single wheat crops in one study, different land uses in preceding years affect grain yield primarily by affecting the harvest index. When the scale changes to cropping rotations, the critical factor affecting overall water use efficiency is found to be the proportion of stored soil water that is transpired by crops. When ordinated in terms of their water use efficiencies, a set of 45 modelled rotation sequences at another location are differentiated mainly by the proportion of pasture in the rotation; when rotations are ordinated using key NRM indicators, the proportion of lucerne pasture is the main distinguishing factor. Finally, we show that for whole crop-livestock farms at three different locations across southern Australia, the pattern of water use efficiencies in the most profitable farming systems changes in similar ways as cropping proportion is altered. At this scale, land use choices affect multiple water use efficiency indices simultaneously and commodity prices determine the balance of the resulting economic tradeoffs. Limitations to the use of the WUE framework arising from its relative simplicity are discussed, as are other areas of farming systems research and development to which it can be applied.

	abstract = {Comparing yields achieved by Bhola farmers in their average, best and worst seasons with yields under optimal management for equivalent seasons, simulated by the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM), showed that farmers should be able to increase productivity of their various crops substantially by using better agronomy. Rabi crops, in descending order of their farmer yields, are ranked boro rice, wheat, followed distantly by the legumes mungbean, cowpea and grasspea. But in terms of their farmer gross margins, which is the difference between the value of goods and cost of inputs, crop rankings changed to wheat-based cropping first, followed by grasspea, boro rice, mungbean and last by cowpea. Under optimal management (APSIM output) Rabi mungbean-based cropping became an outstanding choice based on economics, equating with boro and wheat in poor seasons and beating them in good seasons. In terms of the most profitable annual rotations that farmers could use, wheat/mungbean/transplanted (T.) aman rice was best, followed by wheat/aus rice/T. aman, then by grasspea/aus/T. aman and mungbean/aus/T. aman. The boro/fallow/T. aman combination was poorest. Where weeds, disease and pests were controlled and other aspects of agronomy were optimised through computer simulation, the wheat/mungbean/T. aman rotation was by far the most profitable rotation. But mungbean must be grown under perfect agronomy for good results, something that farmers seldom achieve. It must also have water available to establish the crop after wheat, a commodity that many farmers do not have unless there is sufficient rain in late March, after wheat is harvested.},

It is therefore imperative that crop production in semi-arid areas be improved in order to meet the food demand of the ever increasing human population. No-till farming practices have the potential to increase crop productivity in smallholder production systems of sub-Saharan Africa, but rarely do because of the constraints experienced by these farmers. One of the most significant of these is the consumption of mulch by livestock. In the absence of long term on-farm assessment of the no-till system under smallholder conditions, simulation modelling is a tool that provides an insight into the potential benefits and can highlight shortcomings of the system under existing soil, climatic and socio-economic conditions. Thus, this study was designed to better understand the long term impact of no-till system without mulch cover on field water fluxes and maize productivity under a highly variable rainfall pattern typical of semi-arid South Africa. The simulated on-farm experiment consisted of two tillage treatments namely oxen-drawn conventional ploughing (CT) and ripping (NT). The APSIM model was applied for a 95 year period after first being calibrated and validated using measured runoff and maize yield data. The predicted results showed significantly higher surface runoff from the conventional system compared to the no-till system. Predicted deep drainage losses were higher from the NT system compared to the CT system regardless of the rainfall pattern. However, the APSIM model predicted 62\% of the annual rainfall being lost through soil evaporation from both tillage systems. The predicted yields from the two systems were within},

This study was designed to calibrate the APSIM model so that it could be used as a tool for understanding the long term impact of conservation agriculture techniques (mulching, tine ripping and planting basins) on the productivity of smallholder systems under semi-arid conditions. The APSIM model predicted reasonably well the seasonal and mulching effects on maize production on sand and clay soils. Under these semi-arid conditions the use of 10 kg.N.ha -1 is preferable under both conventional and basin tillage systems. Planting basins offer a better chance of getting maize grain yield than the conventional system in southern Zimbabwe at N quantities ranging from 0 kg.ha -1 to 52 kg.ha -1. This modelling exercise suggested that smallholder farmers are still prone to complete crop failure in some years despite the use of available conservation agriculture systems.},

However, availability of water for irrigation is often limited, making the water-use efficiency (WUE) of a species/genotype an important consideration when designing forage systems. Field experimentation and an associated modelling study was undertaken to determine the WUE and environmental factors influencing WUE for contrasting lucerne (Medicago sativa) genotypes across six dairying regions within Tasmania. In the field experiment a significant genotype influence on WUE was identified under irrigated conditions and modelling identified a genotype influence on WUE in three out of six regions. WUE was related to the amount of water received (irrigation plus rainfall). The marginal response to the application of irrigation water (MWUE) was greatest for the highly winter-active genotype in the field experiment; however, modelling did not identify a consistent genotype influence on MWUE across regions. MWUE was negatively associated with the amount of deep drainage. The present study identified that lucerne has the potential to improve the WUE of forage systems across six different Tasmanian regions. The linkage of MWUE and deep drainage highlights that deficit irrigation practices could further improve the WUE of this forage crop, particularly in environments prone to deep drainage.},

	abstract = {Good germination is a basic requirement for successful sugarcane production. To predict crop emergence and manage early crop development it is necessary to understand the factors that affect germination and early growth. The minimum temperature for bud germination used in the CANEGRO and APSIM crop models is 10 degrees C, based on leaf emergence studies. As the base temperature for emergence for South African cultivars has not been documented previously, a study was initiated to examine the effect of temperature, soil moisture, soil fertility and seed lot on the emergence of cultivars NCo376, N16, N27 and non-fertilised N27. Carefully selected setts were planted in trays filled with soil of 0, 7 and 21\% clay content, in glasshouse cubicles which were set at 30 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 15 degrees C, respectively. A set of planted trays was kept dry while the rest were irrigated according to evaporative demand. Bud emergence from a 60 mm planting depth peaked at 14, 22 and 56 days in the 30, 25 and 20 degrees C cubicles, respectively. Germination in the 15 degrees C environment was very poor and could not be used to determine base temperatures. Using linear extrapolation of the response to temperature, the results indicated that emergence did not take place below 18.1 degrees C for NCo376, 17.8 degrees C for N16 and 16.8 degrees C for N27. Seedcane of unfertilised origin germinated significantly more poorly than that of fertilised origin and sets planted in fertilised soil demonstrated significantly higher emergence counts (p = 0.05) compared to unfertilised soil. Setts planted in sun-dried soil did not grow roots or show signs of bud swelling and differentiation. Results from this study may help explain the poor emergence under cool winter conditions or poor ratoonability experienced under trash. Results also indicated differences in cultivar sensitivity, and the methodology could be used to screen for better adaptation to the cooler Midlands or southern production areas.},

	abstract = {Management options were explored using DairyNZ's Whole Farm Model (WFM) to predict farm-scale milksolids (MS = fat + protein) production and operating profit. Predictions of urinary-N excretions from individual cows were linked to the Agricultural Production System Simulator (APSIM) suite via a Urine Patch Framework (UPF) to estimate N leaching on a farm scale while accounting for urine patches and patch overlaps. The UPF provides the inputs for soil, pasture and crop models in APSIM to simulate soil water, carbon and N dynamics and leaching on an individual urine patch scale. APSIM simulation outputs are then fed back into the UPF, which aggregates the patch-scale predictions up to paddock and farm level to give a mechanistic prediction of N leaching per hectare for the modelled farm. The paper focuses on the methodologies, and demonstrates utility of the WFM-UPF-APSIM linked model by presenting the results for a Canterbury irrigated milking enterprise. The Lincoln University Dairy Farm (LUDF) was used as the baseline farm for the region; it represents a high performing system typical of the Canterbury region.

	title = {Simplifying pastoral systems modelling - accounting for the effect of urine deposition on {N} leaching},
	abstract = {Models are increasingly being used to assess the performance of farming systems. Computer modelling is a cost-effective way to study a wide range of factors and the only way to consider future scenarios. In pastoral systems, it is important to account for urine patches deposited by grazing animals as they are a major source of nitrogen (N) leaching. Explicitly accounting for urine depositions is very challenging because the introduced spatial and temporal variability may require thousands of simulations depending on the system modelled. In this case the computing time becomes a significant limitation so there is a need for methods to reduce computing time of pastoral systems simulations. Here we present an approach that can be used in the APSIM modelling framework to account for the effects of urine patches in a simplified way. Using a meta-model coded as an APSIM module, a fraction of the urine N deposited is removed from the simulation as direct urinary N leaching (Figure 1), the rest is retained in the simulation and is returned to the paddock evenly distributed as mineral N. This approach allows the user to model the whole paddock with relatively simple simulations, enabling to study a wide range of scenarios faster while still appropriately considering the impacts of urine depositions. The proposed meta-model relates the fraction of N leached (f(LEACH)) from urine patches to environmental and management factors. It was constructed using empirical functions derived from a comprehensive N leaching dataset, which was produced using simulations that explicitly described the urine patches. We present in this paper the results using data from the Canterbury region of New Zealand. Stepwise regression and principal components analysis were used to identify the most important factors related to f(LEACH) and then empirical functions were fitted to the dataset using regression analysis. This was performed in three steps to account for the major static factors (soil plant available water, urine N load, annual rainfall and day of urine deposition) and one step accounting for dynamic factors (average temperature on the week prior to urine depositions and soil moisture at the time of deposition). Most of the variation was accounted for by the static factors, and the improvement by using dynamic factors was barely significant. This means that the meta-model lacks sensitivity to year-to-year variations, therefore it is better suited for long-term simulations. However, overall agreement was good (R-2=0.73), with little overall bias. The approach is thus promising, capturing the effects from the largest drivers of N leaching while considerably reducing the simulation time.},

	title = {A meta-model for soil carbon stock in agricultural soils},
	abstract = {Agricultural system models are frequently used to predict soil carbon (C) dynamics in agro-ecosystems at the field scale. Upscaling the results from those process-based models to assess the regional soil C change and sequestration potential is still a challenge due to the lack of detailed spatial information required. Meta-modelling could capture and summarize input-output relationships of systems models through simplified mathematical functions, and can significantly reduce the demand for input data required for initialization and parameterization of process-based models. Such a meta-model can be easily used for spatial assessment across regions. In this paper, we use the widely used Agricultural Production Systems sIMulater (APSIM) to generate simulation data, based on which we try to develop a simple meta-models for simulation of soil C changes across different regions in Australia. We run APSIM for 100 years (1907-2006) at 10 selected sites across the eastern Australia wheat-belt to generate soil C changes under a continuous wheat system. The 10 sites cover three annual rainfall patterns and a wide range of temperature and rainfall conditions, with mean annual rainfall in the wheat growth season ranging from 172 to 510 mm, and mean annual temperature ranging from 7.2 to 18.5 degrees C. For each site, ten soils were used in the simulation to represent various soil types, with plant available water capacity (PAWC) ranging from 66 to 261 mm. The meta-models predict soil C content at the end of the 100-year simulation (C-content) and soil C changes from 1907 to 2006 (C-change). Our simulation results indicated that both C-content and C-change were significantly and positively related to the mean annual amount of retained residue. Residue production was significantly and positively related to PAWC and mean annual evapotranspiration, with the latter closely coupled with radiation (R), temperature (T) and precipitation (P). APSIM simulation outputs at five randomly selected sites from the ten sites and step-wise multiple regressions were used to develop the meta-model. The meta-models of C-content and C-change with a residual error e are as follows: C-content = 90.85 + 0.21C(0) + 0.043PAWC - 0.012R + 0.023P - 2.65T + epsilon, and C-change = 90.85- 0.79C(0) + 0.043PAWC-0.012R + 0.023P - 2.65T + epsilon. The two meta-models could explain 85\% and 87\% of the variation in C content and C change as simulated by APSIM, respectively. The two meta-models were validated using the modelled soil C values from APSIM at other five sites. It could explain 90\% and 91\% of the variation in C-content and C-change predicted by APSIM, respectively. This simulation study suggested that the meta-model based on basic soil and climate data could capture the soil C dynamics in agricultural soils as good as the agricultural systems model APSIM. The meta-model significantly reduces the requirement of input data, and can easily be applied for regional or continental assessment of soil C changes.},

	title = {Linking a whole farm model to the {APSIM} suite to predict {N} leaching on {New} {Zealand} dairy farms},
	abstract = {Nitrogen excreted directly onto pasture on New Zealand dairy farms, particularly from urine, drives most nitrogen (N) leaching. Therefore, the representation of urine patches in different paddocks is important when modelling on-farm N leaching. This paper: 1. describes the Grid and Probabilistic methods in connection with DairyNZ's Whole Farm Model (WFM); and 2. compares N leaching predictions using the Grid and Probabilistic methods for a simulated Waikato (New Zealand) dairy farm on a Horotiu silt loam soil (Typic Orthic Allophanic soil). The Grid method divides the paddock into cells and allocates the urination events randomly for each grazing event and the Probabilistic method calculates the probability using the Poisson distribution of the different temporal urination patterns, estimates the N leaching from each pattern and then calculates the leaching at a paddock level. Different simplifications to each method are required to make the implementation feasible. The modelling in this study uses a new framework called the Urine Patch Framework (UPF) that post-processes the results of the WFM and runs the Agricultural Production System Simulator (APSIM) to simulate the urine patches. The WFM extracts the urine information for each grazing event on each paddock, accounting for the partitioning of the urine between walkways, milking parlour, and the stand-off. Only the fate of urinary N directly excreted onto pastures is analyzed in this study. The UPF breaks each paddock into either cells (Grid method), or areas with different urination patterns (i.e. dates of deposition and amount excreted on each date) (Probabilistic method) and saves the information into text files. The software reads these files and prepares input files (.xml) for APSIM model runs, which are used to invoke APSIM for each cell or pattern. Finally, the leaching data are collected to calculate N leaching for the whole paddock and subsequently the whole farm. The main simplification used in the Probabilistic method is based on the assumption that the effect of one urination event can be neglected after a number of months following deposition (months to remember). This implies that the full simulation period (i.e. the WFM run) can be subdivided into periods of time (months to remember + 1 month), which stops the exponential explosion in the number of possible urination patterns. A range from 6 to 12 months to remember was explored. For one period at a time, all the patterns are created, and later on simulated in APSIM. Nitrogen leaching results are collected only in the last month of the period, whereas the previous months are used to initialize and populate the soil model with relevant historical information (urination events, fertilization, defoliations and climate). Nitrogen leaching predictions from both methods converged when the number of months to remember in the Probabilistic method was approximately 9-10 months. Even with 10 months to remember, the Probabilistic method was computationally more efficient, taking less than half of the time for the 2 year runs compared to the Grid method. For a 2 year run, the processing time was similar for both methods with about 14 months to remember. Ten months to remember was used throughout the rest of the study. The average annual N leaching was similar for the Grid and Probabilistic method (37.0 +/- 14.5 vs. 38.1 +/- 10.9 kg N/ha/year, respectively). However, the Grid method, despite the long processing time, could be used to simulate dung patches to enable predictions of soil carbon balance.},

	abstract = {Climatic variations, continuously increasing population pressure and market infrastructures are driven forces to reduce agricultural productivity. New management options and appropriate genotypes are need of the day to be considered for sustainable production. Crop simulation models are complementary tools in field experiments to develop innovative crop management systems. In this perspective, two crop growth models viz., APSIM (Agricultural Production System Simulator) and DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agro Technology Transfer) were calibrated and validated to predict growth and yield of wheat under rainfed conditions for Pothwar region of Pakistan. Five wheat cultivars; Tatara, NARC-2009, Sehar-2006, SKD-1 and F-Sarhad were planted in plot size of 5 m x 3 m with row spacing of 25 cm arranged in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) replicated thrice during 2008-09 and 2009-10 at Islamabad. Both the models were parameterized using different agronomic parameters (phenological development, drymatter accumulation, leaf area index, physiological indices and grain yield) and climatic data. Efficiency of both models was tested using model validation skill scores including d-stat, RMSE and R-2. RMSE between observed and predicted value by APSIM for drymatter for Tatara genotype was 0.34 t ha(-1) as compared to DSSAT with RMSE 1.40 t ha(-1). Similarly, results observed for grain yield and other agronomic parameters generated by APSIM were more precise while less accurate results were depicted by DSSAT. Poor simulations were observed for Sehar-2006 by both models. While, predicted results for NARC-2009 were close to Tatara, whereas, SKD-1 and F-Sarhad showed similar behaviour. Findings of the study highlighted that crop models as a decision support tool to design agricultural production and crop management system, select suitable crop and genotypes under changing climatic scenario, fertilizer management, weeds management and appropriate sowing time. Similarly, these models are helpful in the managements of biotic and abiotic stresses. Meanwhile, this study will introduce both models under rainfed conditions of Pakistan which will further help to assess the constraints that influenced the model parameterization and validation. A set of validation skill scores were used to evaluate the models to examine their usefulness, representativeness and robustness. Similarly, the focus of the models comparison was based upon crop, soil and climatic data, technique and model outcomes. The results generated by the models will help in evaluating strengths and weakness of each of the modeling approaches, and based on these outcomes recommendations about managements could be made. The results led to the conclusion that APSIM model was more efficient and suitable to simulate wheat growth and development for arid area of Pakistan. Therefore, it can further be used for decision making to mitigate climatic risk, selection of suitable genotypes and management options for agricultural sustainability. Similarly, climatic scenarios analysis might be performed in the APSIM model to mitigate future problems related to climatic extremes, therefore, it's important to design future strategies based upon models outputs.},

	title = {An environmental economic assessment of water sharing alternatives for the {Broken} catchment in the {Northern} {Victoria}},
	abstract = {Combinations of climatic factors and potential policy initiatives such as Sustainable Diversion Limits (SDLs), which define water diversions for consumption while maintaining environmental assets and ecosystem functions, will continue to challenge water resource management in the future. Irrigation currently consumes major share of water entitlements and is likely to be affected in terms of reduced yield and quality as a result of reduced water availability. Previous studies have quantified the economic impacts of water sharing and climate change by only changing irrigable area as a response to variations in water availability. In this study we incorporate complex crop water profit functions, irrigation technology, alternative cropping systems and detailed environmental responses to capture economic and environmental tradeoffs under different climate scenarios and SDLs. Economic and environmental tradeoffs are valued in terms of opportunity cost of foregone agricultural profit and benefit transfer from existing environmental valuation studies. This paper presents environmental and economic responses in the Broken River catchment to analyse alternative water sharing arrangements and examine the tradeoffs. The modelling framework includes a diverse range of tools. Irrigator demand was modeled through representative farm models for irrigated dairy, horticulture and cropping and fodder industries providing optimal water use at the farm level. These were scaled up to the catchment level according to land use areas. The technical coefficients for representative farm models were obtained from experimental trials and biophysical modeling tools, such as DairyMod and APSIM, which provide a way of assessing the impact of a range of changes on pasture systems. The objective function in the model was the maximization of the total gross margin for the farm and subject to constraints. Gross margin was defined as the difference between returns from agricultural produce plus stock sales and variable costs. The environmental assets of concern were native fish, macro invertebrates, riverine vegetation and geomorphology. An expert panel of scientists was formed to consider these categories of environmental requirements (assets) and developed a set of priorities to achieve asset improvement and maintenance of ecosystem functions. Augmented flow requirements for the maintenance of environmental assets were quantified by eflow predicter developed by the eWater Cooperative Research Centre (CRC), against the base line historical regulated river flow. The allocation of water to meet environmental demands was simulated using a daily water resources allocation simulation model Source River developed by eWater CRC, which includes representations of different demands, stream flow and the effect of water supply system constraints. Implications of varying simulated allocations to environmental and irrigation demand were quantified. With decreasing allocation, relative to demand, the economic benefit (for agricultural demand) and the environmental benefits (for the environmental demand) were compromised. Results from the analysis depended on the types of analysis and units of measurement. Environmental outcomes for native fish populations and riverine vegetation were presented in meeting the objectives of environmental improvement specified in the Water Act 2007. Farm-level results were presented as changes in total farm gross margin. Catchment water supply outcomes were presented as changes in stream flows associated with different water sharing rules. These outcomes can be useful for valuing environmental flows by applying benefit transfer of environmental values.},

	title = {Potential yields for wheat crops.},
	abstract = {Due to the hot and dry Rabi season in southern Bangladesh, and the lack of irrigation infrastructure, arable lands in the region were long considered too risky for wheat production. Recent on-farm trials have challenged this perception, with economic wheat yields achieved by southern farmers. The aim of this chapter is to assess the long-term potential wheat yields in southern Bangladesh by combining data from on-farm trials with system modelling to assess the production potential for this region. Field crop-soil-climate datasets collected from on-farm trials were used to set up and test the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model for this production system. Using these data, the feasibility of Rabi-season cropping systems was simulated for 27 years of climate data (1980-2007) in southern Bangladesh, including traditional wheat-production areas and the new areas being considered for cropping. When configured for the local soils and genotypes, the APSIM model adequately simulated a range of wheat yields from the on-farm trials. Importantly, APSIM also mimicked the annual changes in watertable depth as soil water is first used by Rabi crops and then replenished as the wet season commences. Long-term simulations suggest that average wheat yields of over 3 t/ha can be achieved for the most southern sites when a single irrigation is applied at 20 days after sowing (DAS). These sites have high watertables and low salinity and the modelling suggests that yields are supplemented by plants accessing water supplied by the near-surface watertable. The conclusion is less certain for southern sites with high salinity, as APSIM has yet to capture the full impact of salinity on wheat physiology and yield. This study provided promising argument for continued research and development investment into the production of Rabi-season crops using available surface-stored water on currently underutilised lands in southern Bangladesh.},

	abstract = {Agriculture of the inland arid region in Xinjiang depends on irrigation, which forms oasis of Northwest China. The production and water use of wheat, a dominant crop there, is significantly affected by undergoing climate variability and change. The objective of this study is to quantify inter-annual variability of wheat yield and water use from 1955 to 2006. The farming systems model APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator) was used to evaluate crop yield, evapotranspiration (ET), and water use efficiency of winter and spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in Xinjiang from 1955 to 2006. The APSIM model was first calibrated and validated using 6 years of experimental data. The validated model was then applied to simulated wheat yield and ET using climatic and soil data for present crop cultivar. Simulated wheat yield under full irrigation have no significant decreasing trend from 1955 to 2006. Simulated growth duration of winter wheat was significantly decreased. Simulated ET of winter wheat was significantly correlated with measured pan evaporation. Simulated ET of winter wheat decreased significantly during the 52 years, with a decrease rate of 0.813 mm year(-1). Cluster analysis showed that the variations of ET were mainly determined by solar radiation, nothing to do with the changes in temperature. The results identified the change trend of field ET under historical climate change, and determined the main meteorological factors which affect ET in this oasis. These results provide a measure for water demand, crop production and irrigation management under climate change in the oasis.},

	title = {Evaluation of crop growth modelling to support estimates of seasonal cane yield for three mill zones in southern {Queensland}.},
	abstract = {Forecasts of mill zone seasonal cane yield are required by sugar industry sectors at a range of lead times before the crushing season to facilitate forward sale of sugar and for planning the logistics of the crushing season. There have been significant reductions in milling staff allocations to yield estimation in recent decades and mills are seeking additional objective tools to support subjective yield estimates. Simulation modelling has been used for routine estimation of seasonal yield in South Africa since 2001 and at research level to selected regions in Australia since 2005. This paper documents relevant research undertaken for the Bundaberg, Isis and Maryborough mill zones. APSIM 7.0 was used to simulate yields of irrigated autumn and spring plant cane and first ratoon cane from an autumn plant crop grown on two soil types. Simulated yield for assessment dates of 28 February, 30 March, 30 April and 15 September were correlated with actual seasonal yield. Simulation for one soil type and only the average of irrigated autumn and spring planting sequences provided a simple and effective procedure for yield indexing. Initial results showed higher correlations between simulated and actual yield at Bundaberg than for the other two regions. The final predictive model was based on correlations of simulated yield for Bundaberg with actual yields in all regions. Coefficients of determination for regression of simulated yield with actual yield ranged between 0.79 and 0.90 for March and April assessment dates, with root mean square errors for this period ranging between 3.1 and 4.9 tonnes cane/ha for 1999 to 2008 seasons. Model-based estimates were 83 to 100\% successful in indexing the magnitude of seasonal yield relative to actual yield of the previous year between 1999 and 2010 at the end of February when only semi-quantitative yield estimates are required. Simple model based applications may therefore be further developed to support current subjective yield estimating techniques.},

	shorttitle = {A new look at an old practice},
	doi = {10.1016/j.agwat.2010.08.024},
	abstract = {The practice of long fallowing, by omitting a year of cropping, is gaining renewed focus in the low rainfall zone of the northern agriculture region of Western Australia. The impetus behind this practice change has been a reduced use of pasture breaks in cereal crop rotations, and the belief that a fallow can improve soil water accumulation and thus buffer the negative effects of dry seasons on crop yields. We evaluated the benefits of long fallowing (full stubble retention, no weed growth allowed) in a continuous wheat sequence via simulation modelling with APSIM at two rainfall locations and five soil types. The simulated benefits to long fallowing were attributable to soil water accumulation only, as the effects on soil nitrogen, diseases or weeds were not evaluated. The long-term (100 years) mean wheat yield benefit to fallowing was 0.36-0.43 t/ha in clay, 0.20-0.23 t/ha in sand and loam, and 0-0.03 t/ha in shallow sand and shallow bums. Over the range of seasons simulated the response varied from -0.20 to 3.87 t/ha in the clay and -0.48 to 2.0 t/ha for the other soils. The accumulation of soil water and associated yield benefits occurred in 30-40\% of years on better soils and only 10-20\% on poorer soils. For the loam soil, the majority of the yield increases occurred when the growing-season (May-September) rainfall following the fallow was low ({\textless}210 mm) and the difference in plant available soil water at sowing between fallowed and continuously cropped soil was high ({\textgreater}30 mm), although yield increase did occur with other combinations of growing-season rainfall and soil water. Over several years of a crop sequence involving fallow and wheat, the benefits from long fallowing due to greater soil water accumulation did not offset yield lost from omitting years from crop production, although the coefficient of variation for inter-annual farm grain production was reduced, particularly on clay soils during the 1998-2007 decade of below-average rainfall. We conclude that under future drying climates in Western Australia, fallowing may have a role to play in buffering the effects of enhanced inter-annual variability in rainfall. Investigations are required on the management of fallows, and management of subsequent crops (i.e. sowing earlier and crop density) so as to maximise yield benefits to subsequent crops while maintaining groundcover to prevent soil erosion.

For the evaluation, it was compared the values simulated and observed for phenological development (number of days from emergence to flowering) and for growth (total dry matter of shoot (DMt), dry matter of green leaves (DMf), leaf area index (LAI)) and yield (P). The model showed a satisfactory performance to simulate the phenological development for regions near the local calibration. For latitude near equator, Teresina-PI, the. phenological simulation was poor. The simulated growth for leaf area index (LAI) differed from observed, but the simulated total dry matter was similar to observed in the first experiment and not so good in the second experiment. One of the reasons is that the model overestimates the effects of water stress during the experiment. However, the ORYZA-APSIM presented good performance in simulation of the order of productivity at the 5\% level of significance.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.fcr.2010.08.001},
	abstract = {While the amount of nitrogen (N) contributed to agricultural soils by above ground legume biomass can be over 300 kg N/ha when grain is not harvested, its availability to subsequent sugarcane crops is uncertain. In Australia it is generally accepted that inorganic N fertiliser applied to the sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L) crop in the first year (termed the plant crop) following a 'good' legume fallow crop that is not harvested can be substantially reduced, or even eliminated. However, current recommendations do not consider the carry over of legume N to crops beyond the plant crop (termed ratoons), for which standard N fertiliser rates are considered necessary. Based on a simple field experiment extending the duration of a soybean (Glycine max L) fallow and two sugarcane crops (plant and first ratoon), cropping system simulation was used to provide a first estimate of how long and how much soybean N remains available for uptake by sugarcane following a soybean break crop. The soybean and sugarcane rotation plot was carried out at Mossman. Queensland over 3 years during which crop yield, plant N, and total soil C and mineral N were measured. The soybean variety Leichhardt produced 9t/ha (+/-0.7) above ground dry weight, containing 301 kg N/ha (+/-36) which contributed to the soil N stores. After independently developing parameter values for Leichhardt, model simulations were run. The model explained 91\% of the variation observed in soil mineral N to a depth of 1.5 m. Additional legume and sugarcane rotation simulations were run for the Burdekin and Bundaberg sugarcane regions. Across all three study sites the simulations suggested that legume N was available to the sugarcane crop up to the fourth ratoon. Acknowledging the limitations of this initial exploratory study, it is hypothesized that potential reductions in fertiliser application rate could be up to approximately 100\% in the first ratoon, and 60\%, 25\% and 10\% in the subsequent ratoons. These findings require further validation but suggest a potential economic and environmental win-win outcome from refining N management practices in sugarcane-legume rotation cropping systems in Australia and other countries.

Field experiments were carried out at the University of Venda's experimental farm, Thohoyandou over two seasons (season I: February - May 2006; season II: November 2006 - March 2007). The experiments consisted of a factorial combination of P fertilizer rates (0, 30 and 60 kg P ha(-1)) and soybean cultivars (Pan 520RR, Highveld Top, and LS 555) arranged in a randomized complete block design and replicated three times. Crop biomass (three stages: vegetative phase, 50\% flowering and harvest maturity) and grain yield were determined. The (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator) APSIM model (version 5.3) was used to simulate crop biomass and grain yield and to assess the long-term risks associated with yield production of soybean crop. P did not affect crop biomass at harvest maturity but the effect of cultivar was significant (P = 0.01); LS 555 had lower grain yield (701 kg ha(-1)) compared with Pan 520RR (1457 kg ha(-1)) and Highveld Top (1241 kg ha(-1)). There was a strong positive relationship (R(2) = 0.97) between observed and predicted grain yield data but the predicted yields were generally lower than the observed values. These preliminary findings show firstly, that the addition of P may not affect grain yield of soybean in this area, secondly, that Pan 520RR and Highveld Top may be suitable for cultivation in this area, and lastly, that APSIM model may be a useful tool in predicting soybean productivity in this area.},

The dry-land wheat production system of southern Australia, augmented by simulation studies, is used to demonstrate the relative impacts and interactions of a range of pre-crop and in-crop management decisions on water productivity. A specific case study reveals how a novel genetic trait, long coleoptiles that enable deeper sowing, can interact with different management options to increase the water-limited yield of wheat from 1.6 t ha(-1) to 4.5 t ha(-1), reflecting the experience of leading growers. Understanding such interactions will be necessary to capture benefits from new varieties within the farming systems of the future.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.fcr.2010.06.010},
	abstract = {The nitrogen-driven trade-off between nitrogen utilisation efficiency (yield per unit nitrogen uptake) and water use efficiency (yield per unit evapotranspiration) is widespread and results from well established, multiple effects of nitrogen availability on the water, carbon and nitrogen economy of crops. Here we used a crop model (APSIM) to simulate the yield, evapotranspiration, soil evaporation and nitrogen uptake of wheat, and analysed yield responses to water, nitrogen and climate using a framework analogous to the rate-duration model of determinate growth. The relationship between modelled grain yield (Y) and evapotranspiration (ET) was fitted to a linear-plateau function to derive three parameters: maximum yield (Y(max)), the ET break-point when yield reaches its maximum (ET(\#)), and the rate of yield response in the linear phase (Delta Y/Delta ET). Against this framework, we tested the hypothesis that nitrogen deficit reduces maximum yield by reducing both the rate (Delta Y/Delta ET) and the range of yield response to evapotranspiration, i.e. ET(\#) - E(s), where E(s) is modelled median soil evaporation. Modelled data reproduced the nitrogen-driven trade-off between nitrogen utilisation efficiency and water use efficiency in a transect from Horsham (36 degrees S) to Emerald (23 degrees S) in eastern Australia. Increasing nitrogen supply from 50 to 250 kg N ha(-1) reduced yield per unit nitrogen uptake from 29 to 12 kg grain kg(-1) N and increased yield per unit evapotranspiration from 6 to 15 kg grain ha(-1) mm(-1) at Emerald. The same increment in nitrogen supply reduced yield per unit nitrogen uptake from 30 to 25 kg grain kg(-1) N and increased yield per unit evapotranspiration from 6 to 25 kg grain ha(-1) mm(-1) at Horsham. Maximum yield ranged from 0.9 to 6.4 t ha(-1). Consistent with our working hypothesis, reductions in maximum yield with nitrogen deficit were associated with both reduction in the rate of yield response to ET and compression of the range of yield response to ET. Against the notion of managing crops to maximise water use efficiency in low rainfall environments, we emphasise the trade-off between water use efficiency and nitrogen utilisation efficiency, particularly under conditions of high nitrogen-to-grain price ratio. The rate-range framework to characterise the relationship between yield and evapotranspiration is useful to capture this trade-off as the parameters were responsive to both nitrogen supply and climatic factors.

	abstract = {In the North China Plain (NCP), while irrigation using groundwater has maintained a high-level crop productivity of the wheat-maize double cropping systems, it has resulted in rapid depletion of groundwater table. For more efficient and sustainable utilization of the limited water resources, improved understanding of how crop productivity and water balance components respond to climate variations and irrigation is essential. This paper investigates such responses using a modelling approach. The farming systems model APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator) was first calibrated and validated using 3 years of experimental data. The validated model was then applied to simulate crop yield and field water balance of the wheat-maize rotation in the NCP. Simulated dryland crop yield ranged from 0 to 4.5 t ha(-1) for wheat and 0 to 5.0 t ha(-1) for maize. Increasing irrigation amount led to increased crop yield, but irrigation required to obtain maximum water productivity (WP) was much less than that required to obtain maximum crop yield. To meet crop water demand, a wide range of irrigation water supply would be needed due to the inter-annual climate variations. The range was simulated to be 140-420 mm for wheat, and 0-170 mm for maize. Such levels of irrigation applications could potentially lead to about 1.5 m year(-1) decline in groundwater table when other sources of groundwater recharge were not considered. To achieve maximum WP, one, two and three irrigations (i.e., 70, 150 and 200 mm season(-1)) were recommended for wheat in wet, medium and dry seasons, respectively. For maize, one irrigation and two irrigations (i.e., 60 and 110 mm season(-1)) were recommended in medium and dry seasons, while no irrigation was needed in wet season.

	volume = {97},
	doi = {10.1016/j.agwat.2010.01.020},
	abstract = {As water resources are limited and the demand for agricultural products increases, it becomes increasingly important to use irrigation water optimally. At a farm scale, farmer's have a particularly strong incentive to optimize their irrigation water use when the volume of water available over a season is production limiting. In this situation, a farmer's goal is to maximize farm profit, by adjusting when and where irrigation water is used. However, making the very best decisions about when and where to irrigate is not easy, since these daily decisions require consideration of the entire remaining irrigation season. Future rainfall uncertainty further complicates decisions on when and which crops should be subjected to water stress. This paper presents an innovative on-farm irrigation scheduling decision support method called the Canterbury irrigation scheduler (CIS) that is suitable when seasonal water availability is limited. Previous optimal scheduling methods generally use stochastic dynamic programming, which requires over-simplistic plant models, limiting their practical usefulness. The CIS method improves on previous methods because it accommodates realistic plant models. Future farm profit (the objective function) is calculated using a time-series simulation model of the farm. Different irrigation management strategies are tested using the farm simulation model. The irrigation strategies are defined by a set of decision variables, and the decision variables are optimized using simulated annealing. The result of this optimization is an irrigation strategy that maximizes the expected future farm profit. This process is repeated several times during the irrigation season using the CIS method, and the optimal irrigation strategy is modified and improved using updated climate and soil moisture information. The ability of the CIS method to produce near optimal decisions was demonstrated by a comparison to previous stochastic dynamic programming schedulers. A second case study shows the CIS method can incorporate more realistic farm models than is possible when using stochastic dynamic programming. This case study used the FarmWi\$e/APSIM model developed by CSIRO, Australia. Results show that when seasonal water limit is the primary constraint on water availability, the CIS could increase pasture yield revenue in Canterbury (New Zealand) in the order of 10\%, compared with scheduling irrigation using current state of the art scheduling practice.

We calibrated and evaluated the farming systems model APSIM with data from three sites (Luancheng, Yucheng and Fengqiu). The calibrated model was applied to simulate the response of crop yield to climate variation and irrigation. The results show that the APSIM model was able to simulate growth and yield of wheat and maize in a double cropping system. Root mean squared error (RMSE) of yield and biomass simulations were 0.83 and 1.40 t ha(-1) for wheat, 1.07 and 1.70 t ha(-1) for maize, respectively. Soil water and ET were also reasonably predicted, with RMSE of 24.33 mm 1.49 mm d(-1), respectively. The simulated rainfed yield range was 0 similar to 6.1 t ha(-1) for wheat and 0-9.7 t ha(-1) for maize in the double cropping system. Each 60 mm additional irrigation increased crop yield by 1.2 t ha(-1) and 540 mm irrigation would be required to achieve the yield potential of 7.1 t ha(-1) for wheat and 8.3 t ha(-1) for maize. If {\textgreater}180 mm irrigation water was available, partition it to wheat and maize would lead to higher total yield than applying it only to wheat. Changing to a single crop system would lead to significantly lower annual total crop yield, although yield of the single crop could be increased due to increased stored soil moisture.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.compag.2009.12.006},
	abstract = {One of the many challenges facing scientists who conduct simulation and analysis of biological systems is the ability to dynamically access spatially referenced climatic, soil and cropland data. Over the past several years, we have developed an Integrated Agricultural Information and Management System (iAIMS), which consists of foundation class climatic, soil and cropland databases. These databases serve as a foundation to develop applications that address different aspects of cropping systems performance and management. In this paper we present the processes and approaches involved in the development of a climatic data system designed to automatically fetch data from different web sources, consolidate the data into a centralized database, and delivery the data through a web-based interface. Climatic data are usually available via web pages or FTP sites. The exact steps to scrape data from different sources vary depending on how the data are rendered. The climatic data building process presented herein is broken down into 5 major program modules, corresponding to different phases of the process: Data Requester, Data Fetcher, Data Parser, Data Filter, and Data Explorer. The Data Requester is responsible for processing the web pages that lead to the determination of the requested weather data. The Data Fetcher is responsible for fetching weather data that is made available by the data sources based on the request from the Data Requester. The Data Parser is responsible for decompressing and parsing the contents of the original data file and saving the data to an SQL Server 2005 database. The Data Filter is responsible for data quality control and for estimating missing data and saving the filtered data. The Data Explorer is designed to provide web-based user access to the consolidated and filtered climatic data using both dropdown lists and map-based navigation. Three types of data are stored in the process: original climatic data in file format, parsed climatic data in SQL Server database, and filtered climatic data in SQL Server database. The resulting consolidated and filtered climatic database provides a common foundation that allows us to develop diversified applications that require dynamic access to near real-time data. A number of applications have been and are being developed that seamlessly access the foundation class climatic database. Collectively these applications address water conservation, crop production and management, land use suitability analysis, and bioenergy refinery site selection. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {It is essential to provide experimental evidence and reliable predictions of the effects of water stress on crop production in the drier, less predictable environments. A field experiment undertaken in southeast Queensland, Australia with three water regimes (fully irrigated, rainfed and irrigated until late canopy expansion followed by rainfed) was used to compare effects of water stress on crop production in two maize (Zea mays L.) cultivars (Pioneer 34N43 and Pioneer 31H50). Water stress affected growth and yield more in Pioneer 34N43 than in Pioneer 31H50. A crop model APSIM-Maize, after having been calibrated for the two cultivars, was used to simulate maize growth and development under water stress. The predictions on leaf area index (LA!) dynamics, biomass growth and grain yield under rain fed and irrigated followed by rain fed treatments was reasonable, indicating that stress indices used by APSIM-Maize produced appropriate adjustments to crop growth and development in response to water stress. This study shows that Pioneer 31H50 is less sensitive to water stress and thus a preferred cultivar in dryland conditions, and that it is feasible to provide sound predictions and risk assessment for crop production in drier, more variable conditions using the APSIM-Maize model.},

	abstract = {There is increasing focus on greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural systems. One suggested method for increasing the sequestration of carbon (C) within agricultural soils is to increase crop productivity and therefore C input into the soil. However, if enhanced production is achieved via nitrogenous fertilisers, there is a potential tradeoff between decreased C emissions and increased nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions due to the increased soil C and nitrogen (N). An alternative is to incorporate leguminous crops into cereal cropping rotations to provide a biological source of N. However, the likely production of N2O from N released during the decomposition of leguminous residues is unknown as is the impact on C input into the soil when some cereal crops are replaced with grain legumes. Consequently, an analysis of the likely impacts has been undertaken for a subtropical dryland cropping system in Queensland, Australia where soil, climate and management are conducive to denitrification losses. A series of scenarios embracing a range of cropping rotations, N fertilisers and leguminous crops was tested using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM). The model configuration was tested using long term data from the Brigalow Catchment Study site near Theodore, Queensland, Australia (24.81 degrees S, 149.80 degrees E). A wide range of data was used in testing the model for the major terms in the C, N and water balances. Scenario analyses of alternative management systems including the use of fertiliser or legume grain or forage crops within cereal rotations demonstrated that soil C can be managed to some degree via simple changes in agronomic practice. The use of legumes within cereal rotations was not always as effective in reducing N2O emissions as improved fertiliser practice. For example, replacing wheat with chickpea did not reduce N2O emission relative to fertilised systems and did not assist in increasing soil C due to impacts on stubble cover over the important summer months. The fact that some interventions proved counterproductive due to complex feedback mechanisms highlights the need for detailed models which capture the links between water, C, N and management.

	abstract = {The growing demand for maize (Zea mays L.) in intensive livestock and other industries has opened up fresh opportunities for further expansion of the maize industry in Australia, which could be targeted in relatively water rich semi-arid tropical (SAT) regions of the country. This crop simulation study assessed the potential productivity and water requirements of maize peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) rotations for the SAT climatic zone of Australia using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model. APSIM was configured to simulate maize (Pioneer hybrid 3153) either in the dry (May-October) or wet season (November-April) and peanut (cv. Conder) in the following season for three soils found at Katherine (14.48 degrees S, 132.25 degrees E) from 1957 to 2008. The simulated mean total yield potential of the dry season maize and wet season peanut (DMWP) rotation (15-19.2 t/ha) was about 28\% greater than the wet season maize-dry season peanut (WMDP) rotation because of the higher yield potential of maize in the dry season compared to in the wet season. These high yields in the DMWP rotation have been achieved commercially. The overall simulated irrigation water requirement for both rotations, which varied from 11.5 to 13.8 ML/ha on different soils, was similar. The DMWP rotation had 21\% higher water use efficiency. Similar yield and water use efficiency advantages of the DMWP rotation were apparent for eight other agriculturally important locations in the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Queensland. The simulations for Katherine also suggested that the irrigation requirement of the two rotations could increase by 17.5\% in El-Nino years compared to La-Nina years for only a small gain in yield, which has implications for climate change scenarios.

	abstract = {Nowadays policy makers, agronomists and farmers are facing the challenge of restructuring the land use as a follow up of the newly introduced free market rules derived from recent policy revisions. In many cases, agricultural land is mainly covered by crops that are cultivated for decades and the selection of alternative cultivations seems to be a complex problem, mainly due to lack of proposals fitting market needs and farmers experience. Thus, the restructuring of the agricultural land and the formation of a well-balanced and sustainable agriculture, according to the new market demands, constitutes an important research area. The present paper proposes a Web-based Decision Support System capable to support mainly the farmers in the selection procedure of the appropriate alternative crops. The system goes further and provides the information needed and supports the farmer for the whole cultivation period. Moreover, the proposed system provides services through mobile phones since their penetration shows high rates even in population groups like farmers. The analysis, design and implementation of the proposed Decision Support System, as well as the evaluation, are presented and discussed. A selection of five crops (i.e. maize, soybean, sorghum, rapeseed, and cardoon). considered to be reasonable alternatives to traditional cultivars for Greek farmers, was made and related data included into the system.

	doi = {10.1016/j.agee.2009.10.014},
	abstract = {The majority of existing crop growth models has been developed for temperate or subtropical regions and for high input cropping systems. However, climate, soil and management systems are quite different in tropical regions. Therefore, crop growth models in tropical regions require extended testing under a range of climatic, soil and management conditions. Multi-location calibration and validation of the EPIC (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate) model for maize production has been carried out using data sets from 22 sites in the semi-arid and sub-humid tropics in West Africa and North-East Brazil. The data sets originated from field experiments on research stations as well as on-farm trials with various treatments over one to four cropping seasons. The calibration procedure revealed the necessity to distinguish between local and improved varieties and to take into account specific parameterization requirements of hydromorphic soils influenced by groundwater or water-logging. Validation with grain yield data from 141 cropping seasons proved to be satisfactory with a mean error (ME) of 0.01 t ha(-1) and a mean relative error (MIRE) of 4\%. However, the coefficient of determination for the regression between simulated and observed maize yields was quite low with a R(2)-value of 0.69. Detailed analysis of the validation data set showed that model performance depends partially on soil acidity, with the poorest R(2)-value of 0.40 on highly acidic soils with aluminum saturation of more than 35\% (Alumi-Haplic Acrisols, Ferralsols and Ferralic Cambisols). When data of the other sites were pooled the R(2)-value of the regression between simulated and observed maize yields was 0.79, which means that the model explained about 80\% of the variance in crop yield. It is concluded that upscaling of the model to the regional scale requires the quantification of the usage of improved varieties and information about the extent of highly acid soils in the target region.

	doi = {10.1016/j.eja.2009.09.005},
	abstract = {Soil fertility and climate risks are hampering crop production in the Sahelian region. Because experiments with only a few fertility management options on a limited number of sites and years cannot fully capture the complex and highly non-linear soil-climate-crop interactions, crop growth simulation models may suitably complement experimental research to support decision making regarding soil fertility and water management. By means of a long term (23 years) scenario analysis using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model, this study investigates millet response to N in view of establishing N recommendations better adapted to subsistence small-holder millet farming in the Sahel. Prior to this, the APSIM model was tested on a rainfed randomized complete block experiment carried out during the 1994 and 1995 cropping seasons, having contrasting rainfall conditions. The experiment combined, at three levels each, the application of cattle manure (300, 900 and 2700 kg ha(-1)), millet residue (300, 900 and 2700 kg ha(-1)) and mineral fertilizer (unfertilized control, 15 kg N ha(-1) + 4.4 kg P ha(-1) and 45 kgN ha(-1) + 13.1 kg P ha(-1)) at ICRISAT Sahelian Center, Niger. The model suitably predicted plant available water PAW and the simulated water and nitrogen stress were in agreement with measurement (water) and expectation (N) regarding the fertilizer and rainfall conditions of the experiment. APSIM simulations were in satisfactory agreement with the observed crop growth except for the highest crop residue application rates ({\textgreater}900 kg ha(-1)). For biomass and grain yield, the model performance was relatively good in 1994 but biomass yields were slightly overpredicted in 1995. The model was able to adequately reproduce the average trend of millet grain yield response to N inputs from manure and fertilizer, and to predict the overall observed higher grain yield in 1995 compared to 1994, despite the better rainfall in 1994. The 23-year, long term scenario analysis combining different application rates of cattle manure. millet residue and mineral fertilizer, showed that moderate N application (15 kg N ha(-1)) improves both the long term average and the minimum yearly guaranteed yield without increasing inter-annual variability compared to no N input. Although it does imply a lower average yield than at 30 kg N ha(-1), the application of 15 kg N ha(-1) appears more appropriate for small-holder, subsistence farmers than the usual 30 kg N ha(-1) recommendation as it guarantees higher minimum yield in worst years, thereby reducing their vulnerability.

The model is sensitive to various environmental conditions (soil and climate) and management options (timing and application rate). The model satisfactorily described results from lysimeter experiments which showed that DCD reduced nitrate leaching by 25-50\%, depending on soil and environmental conditions. The model was used to evaluate the effectiveness of DCD applications in different months and with different periods between urine and DCD applications. It is shown that DCD effectiveness in highest on winter and a lag between urine deposition and DCD application can greatly reduce the effect of DCD especially in summer. The model is a promising tool for determining DCD effectiveness under various conditions and for aiding the development of best management practices.},

	abstract = {This thesis is an account of the development and use of a framework to introduce flexibility in crop modelling. The construction of such a framework is supported by two main beams: the implementation and the modelling beam. Since the beginning of the 1990s, the implementation beam has gained increasing attention in the crop modelling field, notably with the development of APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator) in Australia, OMS (Object Modelling System) in the United States, and APES (Agricultural Production and Externalities Simulator) in Europe. The main focus of this thesis is on the modelling beam and how to combine it with the implementation beam. I first explain how flexibility is adopted in crop modelling and what is required for the implementation beam of the framework, namely libraries of modules representing the basic crop growth and development processes and of crop models (i.e. modelling solutions). Then, I define how to deal with this flexibility (i.e. modelling beam) and more specifically I describe systematic approaches to facilitate the selection of the appropriate model structure (i.e. a combination of modules) for a specific simulation objective. While developing the framework, I stress the need for better documentation of the underlying assumptions of the modules and of the criteria applied in the selection of these modules for a particular simulation objective. Such documentation should help to point out the sources of uncertainties associated with the development of crop models and to reinforce the role of the crop modeller as an intermediary between the software engineer, coding the modules, and the end users, using the model for a specific objective. Finally, I draw conclusions for the prospects of such a framework in the crop modelling field. I see its main contribution to (i) a better understanding in crop physiology through easier testing of alternatives hypotheses, and (ii) integrated studies by facilitating model reuse.},

Cluster analysis of the pattern of crop water stress experienced by each simulated crop was used to devise season types for the study sites. Average crop moisture stress for two periods up to grain filling, i. e. germination to 6008 degrees C days of thermal accumulation (similar to Zadoks 0-32) and from 600 to 1200 days of thermal accumulation (similar to Zadoks 32-71), was used to devise a classification of season type: low moisture stress early and late (L-L), low early and high late (L-H), high early and low late (H-L) and high early and late (H-H). Using regional rainfall we found that El Nino events are associated with double the risk of the season being in the lowest tercile from 33 to 67\% and La Nina events increase the chance of being in the top tercile to 50\%. Although there was a wide range of simulated yields in El Nino and La Nina years, for most sites the average yields were lower in El Nino years and higher in La Nina years. For most sites in the study 6 or 7 of the worst 10 years were El Nino, 3 Neutral and 1 or nil cases were La Nina events. This contrasts with a pattern assuming no El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influence of 2 El Nino, 6 Neutral and 2 La Nina events. Analysis of the relationship of season types identified by the cluster analysis to ENSO showed significant results for high-rainfall sites but not for low-rainfall sites. One of the reasons for this is that in low-rainfall sites, moisture stress occurs in most seasons. We conclude that there is good reason for farmers and advisers in South Australia to pay attention to a forecast of ENSO for the coming season as one part of their risk management strategy. We conclude on the need to think clearly about drought and aridity in these low-rainfall environments and comment on how this analysis further questions canopy management as a means of dealing with drought risk.},

	abstract = {Empirical and simulation results from three crop rotations incorporating cereals, pulses and nitrogen (N) fertiliser application were examined over 4 years in a subtropical environment, central Queensland, Australia. The hypothesis was that pulse crops in rotation with cereals would be a viable alternative to applying N fertilisers and would improve farm business economic performance provided the yield potential of pulses were not compromised by planting into very low soil water situations. Empirical data and simulations with the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator model were used to give insights into the N contribution, yield benefit to cereals and overall economic performance of the inclusion of pulses into the rotation. The field trial rotations included: rotation 1: sorghum and wheat in an opportunity crop rotation (called cereals-only), rotation 2; cereals grown following a fallow with a pulse crop immediately after (called cereal double-cropped pulse) and rotation 3, pulses grown following a fallow with a cereal crop immediately after (called pulse double-cropped cereal). Empirical and simulated results indicated that the cereal double-cropped pulse rotation produced the highest average annual gross margins using prices at that time. In the simulations, when pulse crops were included in the rotation, no additional N fertiliser was required and the lowest chance of negative gross margins was obtained. The cereal double-cropped pulse rotation produced the largest trial and simulated gross margins. The pulse double-cropped cereal rotation produced greater gross margins than the N-deficient cereals-only rotation but significantly lower than the cereal double-cropped pulse rotation. Simulations indicated that the cereals-only rotation could be made profitable when the soil was 'topped-up' to 100 kg available N/ha before planting, or by 40 kg N/ha to each cereal crop. Chickpea and mungbean contributed an average of 35 and 29 kg N/ha, respectively, in the field trial. A minimum of 100 mm of the stored soil water at planting was needed to reduce the risk of negative returns. By planting only when the soil contained adequate water, the cereal double-cropped pulse rotation may provide a valuable supplement to farm income while simultaneously reducing the need for N fertilisers on the cereals. Alternatively, in a rotation with cereals only, modest amounts of fertiliser N will maintain profitability with minimal levels of financial risk.},

	abstract = {Cropping fields often have poor-performing patches. In an attempt to increase production on poor patches, farmers may apply additional fertiliser or ameliorants without economic or scientific justification. Improved understanding of the extent and causes of poor performance, management options, potential crop yield and economic benefits can give farmers the tools to consider management change. This paper presents an approach to integrating farmer knowledge, precision agriculture tools and crop simulation modelling to evaluate management options for poor-performing patches. We Surveyed nine cropping fields in Western Australia and showed that (1) farmers have good understanding of the spatial extent and rank performance of poor-performing areas, when compared to NDVI or yield maps, (2) there is a wide range of physical and chemical soil constraints to crop yield in such patches, some of which can be ameliorated to raise yield potential, and others where crop inputs such as fertiliser can be better matched to low yield potential. Management options for poor-performing patches were evaluated through simulation analysis by removal of constraints to rooting to varying extents, and hence plant available water capacity. These examples show that if the constraint is mis-diagnosed then the potential benefits from amelioration can be overstated. In many cases constraints, often associated with physical limitations such as shallow available rooting depth or light-texture cannot be ameliorated or are uneconomic to ameliorate. In such cases the best intervention may be to lower crop inputs to better match the water-limited yield potential of such poor-performing areas. This research integrated farmer knowledge and spatial data to define yield zones in which targeted soil sampling and crop simulation were then used to determine yield potential and particular constraints to that potential. The economic costs and benefits of differential zone management were examined under a range of husbandry scenarios and, importantly, the sensitivity of economic gain to mis-diagnosis or errors in defining the zones was tested. This approach provided farmers with a robust and credible method for making decisions about spatial management of their fields. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

	doi = {10.1016/j.pce.2010.07.036},
	abstract = {There is big effort to disseminate conservation tillage practices in Tanzania. Despite wide spread field demonstrations there has been some field experiments meant to assess and verify suitability of the tillage options in local areas. Much of the experiments are short lived and thus long term effects of the tillage options are unknown. Experiments to study long term effects of the tillage options are lacking because they are expensive and cannot be easily managed. Crop simulation models have the ability to use long term weather data and the local soil parameters to assess long term effects of the tillage practices. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) crop simulation model; was used to simulate long term production series of soil moisture and grain yield based on the soil and weather conditions in Mkoji sub-catchment of the great Ruaha river basin in Tanzania. A 24 year simulated maize yield series based on conventional tillage with ox-plough, without surface crop residues (CT) treatment was compared with similar yield series based on conservation tillage (ox-ripping, with surface crop residues (RR)). Results showed that predicted yield averages were significantly higher in conservation tillage than in conventional tillage (P {\textless} 0.001). Long term analysis, using APSIM simulation model, showed that average soil moisture in the conservation tillage was significantly higher (P {\textless} 0.05) (about 0.29 mm/mm) than in conventional tillage (0.22 mm/mm) treatment during the seasons which received rainfall between 468 and 770 mm. Similarly the conservation tillage treatment recorded significantly higher yields (4.4 t/ha) (P {\textless} 0.01) than the conventional tillage (3.6 t/ha) treatment in the same range of seasonal rainfall. On the other hand there was no significant difference in soil moisture for the seasons which received rainfall above 770 mm. In these seasons grain yield in conservation tillage treatment was significantly lower (3.1 kg/ha) than in the conventional tillage treatment (4.8 kg/ha) (P {\textless} 0.05). Results also indicated a probability of 0.5 of getting higher yield in conservation than in conventional tillage practice. The conservation tillage treatment had the ability to even-out the acute and long intra-seasonal dry spells. For example a 36-days agricultural dry spell which occurred between 85th and 130th day after planting in the 1989/1990 season (in the CT treatment) was mitigated to zero days in the},

	abstract = {This paper presents an interdisciplinary approach to crop improvement that links physiology with plant breeding and simulation modelling to enhance the selection of high-yielding, drought-tolerant varieties. In a series of field experiments in Queensland, Australia, we found that the yield of CIMMYT wheat line SeriM82 ranged from 6\% to 28\% greater than the current cultivar Hartog. Physiological studies on the adaptive traits revealed that SeriM82 had a narrower root architecture and extracted more soil moisture, particularly deep in the profile. Results of a simulation analysis of these adaptive root traits with the cropping system model APSIM for a range of rain-fed environments in southern Queensland indicated a mean relative yield benefit of 14.5\% in water-deficit seasons. Furthermore, each additional millimetre of water extracted during grain filling generated an extra 55 kg ha-1 of grain yield. Further root studies of a large number of wheat genotypes revealed that wheat root architecture is closely linked to the angle of seminal roots at the seedling stage - a trait which is suitable for large-scale and cost-effective screening programmes. Overall, our results suggest that an interdisciplinary approach to crop improvement is likely to enhance the rate of yield improvement in rain-fed crops.},

Treading by livestock can reduce soil porosity and infiltration rate, and increase soil bulk density and soil strength, although these effects are mainly in the soil surface (top 5-10 cm). Despite these effects, rarely have reductions in crop performance been measured. This simulation analysis used APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator) to investigate the sensitivity of wheat crop growth and yield to reductions in root growth and water conductivity in the surface soil (0-10cm). Mild surface soil compaction was found to reduce grain yield by less than 10\%. In more severe cases, crop losses could be up to 30\%, especially if surface conductivity was greatly reduced and ground cover levels were low. Crop growth and yield were more sensitive to reduced surface conductivity and rainfall infiltration than to reduced root growth in surface layers.},

We have employed the APSIM model framework with a newly developed pasture module to describe the results of an experiment where lysimeters were treated with a load of 1000 kg/ha of nitrogen as urine. To model this data we used a mechanistic soil model with NH 4 adsorption modelled by a Freundlich isotherm The model showed good agreement with measured drainage and both NO 3 and NH 4 leaching. The effect of the assumption that NH 4 is completely immobile was compared with the Freundlich isotherm and found to underestimate leaching by 20\% in this loamy soil. In soils, such as sandy soils, with lower adsorption capacity the underestimation is expected to be greater.},

In the first approach the exponential degradation of DCD was assumed to be driven by soil temperature, soil moisture content and soil pH, similarly to the nitrification process. In the second approach environmental conditions throughout the degradation process were assumed to remain constant, and the temperature effect on degradation was based on an empirical relationship developed by Kelliher et al. (Kelliher, 2008). The model was parameterised using lysimeter data and then used to evaluate the effect of various environmental conditions (soil conditions, rainfall pattern, temperature) and management options (timing and rate of DCD application) on the effectiveness of DCD in reducing nitrate leaching under grazed pastures.},

	abstract = {Conservation agricultural practices (CAPs) have been suggested to be an effective way to enhance carbon (C) sequestration in agricultural soils to mitigate climate change. In this paper, we synthesised data from 49 peer-reviewed papers to examine the effects of adopting CAPs on soil C dynamics in Australian agro-ecosystems. We also used the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) to simulate changes in soil C under an annual wheat system as affected by nitrogen (N) application and stubble management across the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB). These results show that in Australian agro-ecosystems, cultivation led to C loss for more than 40 years, with a total loss of {\textasciitilde}50\% in the surface 0.1 m of soil. Adoption of CAPs generally increased soil C. Increasing crop frequency and perennial crops, when combined with stubble retention, had the greatest impact on increasing soil C, but the long-term impacts remain unclear. The same CAPs can have different outcomes on soil C under different climate and soil combinations. Modelling results using APSIM show that under an annual wheat system, 100\% stubble retention and optimal N supply would lead to a basin-wide average increase in soil C of 8 Mg ha -1 to a depth of 1.5 m in 100 years. Under such a system, the rates of soil C accumulation increases along a transect from northwest to southeast of MDB. Fertilization and stubble retention must be combined in order to achieve the full C sequestration potential of the system. A modeling approach, combined with measurements, is an effective way to estimate the spatial distribution of soil C sequestration.},

	abstract = {Spatially dense, geo-referenced information is an integral component of precision agriculture (PA) management. Moreover, the value of temporally dense information is gaining recognition. An example of such valuable information is crop yield data. An intuitively appealing response to these information requirements is simulation modelling. In order to meet the temporal density and the spatial extent requirements of PA, simulation modelling is faced with a major challenge: that of capturing yield variation at a spatial resolution relevant to PA. Adequate computer power to run a representative number of simulations ({\textgreater}1,000) and suitable information to populate the models are the motivating challenges behind this study. Inverse meta-models were derived from the agricultural production simulator (APSIM) using neural network modelling to predict soil-available water capacity (AWC). Using as many years of yield data as was available for a dryland grain farm in Australia, 'effective' AWC maps with a resolution of 10 m were made by averaging maps estimated from different yield years. The AWC values were validated in terms of value for predicting spatially variable yield. The AWC maps were significantly different, depending on the year of yield data used. This demonstrated that the 'effective' component of the AWC values contains information about climate interacting with the soil, the crop, and the landscape. The AWC values proved useful for predicting yield using simple linear models (0.48 {\textless} R(2) {\textless} 0.80) rather than using APSIM. A conclusion from this study is that the inverse meta-modelling concept is an efficient way of extracting soil physical information that exists within crop yield maps. Further research attempting to enhance understanding about the 'effective' components of the AWC values and to improve the temporal consistence of the AWC values is important. A greater number of AWC scenarios, more years of yield data, and the inclusion of additional information into the meta-models are possible ways forward.},

Against this backdrop, the potential impact of climate change on sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor) and cowpea ( Vigna unguiculata) production in the semi-arid areas of Kenya will be assessed using the Agricultural Production System Simulator (APSIM). The study will employ participatory tools in the use of APSIM model to identify risks and cropping system improvement options and designing cropping strategies for field experimentation. The field experiments will be conducted in Makueni district of Eastern Province, Kenya. Initially, a farmers' workshop will be held to gather information on farmers' experience with recent climatic changes and possible causes, effect on current farming systems, coping and adaption strategies to current management practices. Farm households' perceptions of risks, options to reduce climatic risks, specific vulnerabilities of the current cropping systems and coping strategies will be documented using semi-structured interviews during farm surveys. This is in addition to establishing the socio-economic and agricultural systems setting of the smallholder farmers. Potential technologies to address the anticipated negative impacts of climate change in respect of cowpea (legume) and sorghum (cereal) cropping system will jointly be identified with the farmers and a subset of tactical adaptation options identified. The options will initially be tested on-station in the first year and on farm in the second year. The on station experiments will be conducted for two (four seasons) years to model sorghum and cowpea growth and soil-water, soil organic carbon and nitrogen dynamics in a legume-cereal cropping system. The APSIM model will be validated to simulate both the legume and cereal components of the cropping system. The integrity of the simulated system will be evaluated by comparing the simulated performance of the crops with actual experimental crop data and by exploring other facets such as water use, denitrification and leaching. It is envisioned that the APSIM model will allow for quick exploration of production outcomes of a range of management alternatives under a range of climatic scenarios (realized or predicted), and for a range of soil conditions. This is in addition to provision of valuable information for evaluating a wide range of cropping system options.},

Crop yield was highly related with annual precipitation and its seasonal distribution. The seasonal distribution of precipitation had a positive U-shaped quadratic relation with wheat and pea yield. Precipitation in the months of June and July significantly influenced wheat yield, while that in the months of May and June importantly influenced pea yield. With 1.0 mm increase in precipitation, wheat and pea yield increased at the rate of 10.4 and 10.3 kg/hm 2, respectively.

	doi = {10.1016/j.fcr.2009.07.012},
	abstract = {In regions where rainfall is low and variable, water stored in the soil profile prior to sowing can alter yield expectation and hence management decisions. Thus, wheat farmers in Mediterranean regions may be able to benefit from knowing the amount of soil water at sowing by optimising their nitrogen (N) fertiliser management and by deciding on whether or not to sow a crop. We used the ASPIM-Nwheat model to explore how levels of plant available soil water (PAW) at sowing, N fertiliser rate, soil, site and season-type (below or above median rainfall) affected wheat yields at sites in the Mediterranean area of southwest Australia. Overall, the greatest influence on yield potential and the consequent N fertilisation requirement was season-type. The additional yield per mm PAW at sowing was generally higher in seasons with below median rainfall, except when yields were severely water-limited by below median rainfall of {\textless}222 mm combined with {\textless}40 mm PAW at sowing on light clay soil with 109 mm plant available water capacity (PAWC). Sowing was generally warranted; only on light clay soil with {\textless}10 mm PAW at sowing and below median rainfall of {\textless}222 mm was there all opportunity for a conditional sowing strategy. Scope for varying N fertiliser rates with PAW at sowing was limited to soils with higher PAWC (109 and 130 mm, respectively) in below median rainfall seasons at the wetter site (295 mm mean seasonal rainfall), and in both season-types at the drier site (225 mm mean seasonal rainfall). Only in these combinations, soil water at sowing modified the optimal N fertiliser rate for maximum average yield resulting in significant interactions between PAW at sowing and N fertiliser rates. Similar interactions were found for a site in the Mediterranean Basin and a site in the eastern Australian subtropics on soil with high PAWC (183 and 276 mm, respectively). In contrast, there was no benefit from modifying crop management based on PAW at sowing on soil with low PAWC (i.e. sandy soil) and/or under conditions of high in-season rainfall. The conditional N management approach becomes more viable as the proportion of water stored in the soil prior to sowing increases relative to total crop water use and as the PAWC of the soil increases. Knowledge of PAW at sowing x N fertiliser rate interactions in a particular soil x site x season-type context call help to identify sites where a more targeted N management dependent on amounts of PAW at sowing is potentially profitable.

	volume = {113},
	doi = {10.1016/j.fcr.2009.06.008},
	abstract = {In the Mediterranean farming systems of the Western Australian wheatbelt, crop yields are influenced primarily by the amount and distribution of rainfall and the soil's capacity to hold moisture. The wheatbelt's growing season rainfall varies in the range of 200-400 mm (average) and the plant available water holding capacity (PAWC) of soils is generally in the 40-140 mm range. The grain yield of wheat is sensitive to this combination of small rainfall and small storage capacity. In this study, we explore the relationship between yield and PAWC using a combination of simulation modelling and analysis of field data. Crop yields and soil properties were monitored in detail at 17 locations (PAWCs 43-131 mm) across six seasons (1997-2005). Crop yields were also simulated using the APSIM crop simulator (RMSE = 311 kg/ha) to evaluate the long-term relationship between crop yield and plant available water capacity using 106 years of historical climate data. The relationship between crop yield and PAWC varied with season, and two important factors emerged: (1) for PAWC {\textless} 65 mm, there was a linear relationship with crop yields that ranged from 17 kg/ha/mm to 58 kg/ha/mm of PAWC across seasons; (2) for PAWC 65-131 mm the crop yield response to PAWC ranged from 11.5 kg/ha/mm in 45\% of seasons to no response. The impact of PAWC on crop yield was reduced in seasons with late rainfall, and magnified in seasons with reduced rainfall late in the growing season. Six distinct season types with different yield-PAWC relationships are identified and season-specific management strategies that exploit within-field variation in PAWC are developed to manage the spatial variation of PAWC in a field.

The potential value of historical climate records increases exponentially with the number of years of data. In order to confidently quantify the long term optimal nitrogen application rate at the study site at least 30 years of climate data are required. For nitrogen management only, the potential value of a perfect climate forecast is about \$54/ha/year with a reduction of excess nitrogen application of 20 kg N/ha/year. The value of an ENSO based forecast system is \$2/ha/year. Perfect forecasting of three or six categories of growing season rainfall would have a value of \$10-12/ha/year. Perfect forecasts of three or six categories of simulated crop yield would bring about \$33-34/ha/year.

	abstract = {The cropping systems model APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems slMulator) was applied to assess the response of sorghum grain yield to inorganic fertilizers applications and residue retention in diverse farmers' management systems (homestead fields and bush farms). The model was parameterized using data collected from experiments under optimum growth conditions (limited water or nutrient stress). Independent data from field experiments with three levels of P and four levels of N fertilizers conducted at two different locations and soils were used to evaluate the model. Soil water and fertility parameters measured were used for simulations while same starting conditions were assumed for unmeasured parameters for all trials. APSIM predicted the grain yield response of sorghum to both N and P applications with an overall modified internal coefficient of efficiency of 0.64. Following model parameterization, a long-term simulation study was conducted using a stochastic weather data derived from historical weather data to assess the effects of crop residue management on grain production. A gradual decline in sorghum grain yield was simulated over the 30-year simulation period in both the homestead fields and the bush farms, with yields being much lower in the latter under farmers' management practices. Half the amount of mineral N fertilizer used in the bush farms was needed in the homestead fields to produce the average grain yields produced on the bush farm with full fertilization, if crop residues were returned to the fields in the homestead. Year-to-year variability in grain yield was consistently higher with the removal of crop residues, irrespective of management systems. APSIM was responsive to both organic and inorganic fertilizer applications in the study area and also highlighted the essential role of crop residues and inorganic fertilizer in influencing the temporal sorghum grain production and hence the impact of farmers' management practices on food security. This was evident in the rapid decline in soil organic carbon (SOC) accompanied by a decline in grain yield over the 30 years of cropping. The use of inorganic fertilizer and retention of crop residues (SOC) are critical for attaining food security in the study area. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for up-scaling field irrigation losses and quantifying relative losses at the irrigation area level for potential water savings. Two levels of analysis were considered: First, the field level where irrigation is applied. Second, the irrigation area level, where the field level losses are aggregated, or up-scaled, using average loss functions. In this up-scaling approach, detailed crop-soil-water modelling can capture the variability of physical parameters (such as soils, crops, water table depth, and management practices) at the field level which are then used to derive loss functions for aggregating losses at higher scales (irrigation area level). This allows potential field-level adaptations and water management changes made by individual farmers to be assessed for impact at the larger irrigation area level. The APSIM farming systems model was used for simulation of crops (wheat, rice, and soybean) and their interaction with the wider system processes at the field level. Given the climate, soil, and management information (sowing, fertilisation, irrigation, and residue management), the model simulates infiltration, the soil moisture profile, plant water uptake, soil evaporation, and deep drainage on a daily basis. Then, by placing the field level analysis in the context of the wider irrigation system or catchment, it is possible to correlate field level interventions (e.g. water savings measures) with water requirements at these higher levels. Application of this method in the Coleambally Irrigation Area in NSW, Australia, demonstrated that an exponential function can describe the relationship between deep drainage losses and the water table depth for different soil, crop, and water table depth combinations. The rate of loss increase (slope of the curve) with the water table depth is higher on lighter (higher intake rates) soils than on heavy soils and is more pronounced in areas under rice cultivation. We also demonstrate that this analysis technique can assist in identifying spatial distribution of losses in irrigation areas, considering water table depth as an additional factor, leading to targeted areas for water-saving measures.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.agsy.2009.03.003},
	abstract = {In African smallholder agriculture, improved farm-scale understanding of the interaction between the household, crops, soils and livestock is required to develop appropriate strategies for improving productivity. A combination of models was used to analyse land use and labour allocation strategies for optimizing income for wealthy (2.5 ha with eight cattle) and poor (0.9 ha Without cattle) farms in Murewa, Zimbabwe. Trade-offs between profitability, labour use and partial nutrient balances were also evaluated for alternative resource management strategies. Farm data were captured using the Integrated Modelling Platform for Mixed Animal-Crop Systems (IMPACT), which was directly linked to the Household Resource use Optimization Model (HROM). HROM was applied to optimize net cash income within the constraints specific to the households. Effects of alternative nutrient resource management strategies in crop and milk production were simulated using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) and RUMI-NANT models, respectively, and the output evaluated using HROM. The poor farm had a net income of US\$ 1 yr(-1) and the farmer relied on selling unskilled labour to supplement her income. The poor farm's income was marginally increased by US\$18 yr(-1) and the soil nitrogen (N) balance was increased from 6 to 9 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) by expanding groundnut production from the previous 5-25\% of the land area. Further increases in area allocated to groundnut production were constrained by lack of labour. On the poor farm, maize production was most profitable when cultivated on a reduced land area with optimal weeding. The wealthy farm had a maize-dominated cropping system that yielded a net cash balance of US\$290 yr(-1), mainly from the sale of crop produce. Net income could be increased to US\$1 175 yr(-1), by re-allocating the 240 hired labour-days more efficiently, although this reallocation substantially reduced partial soil N and phosphorus (P) balances by 74 kg N ha(-1) and 11 kg P ha(-1), respectively, resulting in negative nutrient balances. Few opportunities existed to increase productivity and income of the smallholder farms without inducing negative nutrient balances. On the wealthy farm, groundnut was the least profitable crop; shifting its production to the most fertile field did not improve income unless the groundnut residues were fed to lactating cows. The analysis carried out in this paper highlights the need to develop practical technological recommendations and development interventions that consider farm resource endowment (land, fertilizers, manure and labour), variability in soil fertility within farms and competing resource use options.

	abstract = {Research about spatio-temporal variation of crop yield does not abound. From a precision agriculture (PA) perspective and particularly considering site-specific crop management (SSCM), this is an aberration. There is a serious need to further question how temporal variation of crop yield impacts ones ability to manage spatial variation. The aim of this study is to consider and develop new and existing approaches to this question. Spatio-temporal analysis was undertaken for two wheat fields in South Australia with 3 and 4 years of wheat yield data. Temporal analysis included the calculation of semi-variance across each field between pairs of years for the creation of maps and the calculation of rank correlations between pairs of years. These analyses supported previous notions that the magnitude of temporal variation is large compared with spatial variation. However, some consistence of spatial patterns between years was also observed for each of the fields indicating that considering magnitudes of variation alone is not an exhaustive analysis. A long-term (100 years) temporal analysis using variograms was undertaken for a single point simulated using the Agricultural Production Simulator Model (APSIM). The long-term analysis overcame the fact that 3 or 4 years of yield data are an extremely small sample size for the time dimension. This analysis provided some useful insight into temporal variation such as a large nugget variance accounting for 75\% of the temporal variation and the cyclical nature of temporal yield variation. A novel use of pseudo cross semi-variograms was applied to a spatio-temporal analysis of yield variation for the two fields. This analysis provides a preliminary insight into identifying space-time variance equivalents. With greater depth of temporal crop yield data this is a promising perspective from which to identify optimal spatial management strategies. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sowing date and cultivar choice influence yield of wheat in Mediterranean climatic regions where crop production is constrained by waterlogging in winter on clay soils and terminal water deficit in spring. Because of the large seasonal variability in Mediterranean environments, a combination of experimental data and simulation results were used to investigate optimal sowing date and cultivar choice. The Agricultural Production Systems SIMulator (APSIM), which had been rigorously tested for bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in Mediterranean-type environments, was further tested with measured durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum) experimental data from the Mediterranean basin. The model reproduced most of the observed seasonal variability of grain yields but tended to overestimate, particularly some of the observed low grain yields. Comparing the model with detailed field experiments from two seasons and three durum wheat cultivars over a wide range of sowing dates highlighted the importance of reproducing the measured phenology and in particularly the observed anthesis dates for the general performance of the model. The use of a specific phyllochron for each sowing date instead of a single value per cultivar regardless of sowing date, as in APSIM, improved anthesis predictions and other aspects of the model. Hence, the phyllochron was varied in the model through a simple relationship based on observed phyllochrons and sowing dates. The new phyllochron routine was then used to explore management options to increase yields by combining the model with 47 years of historical weather records from Oristano, Sardinia, Italy. The simulation results showed that sowing wheat before December can result in higher yields in the absence of waterlogging. However, the high frequency of waterlogging on the clay soils, even with the observed decline of rainfall in the last 20 years in winter, showed no average yield advantage of sowing before December. Early maturing cultivars outperformed late cultivars at standard and late sowing dates. Hence, sowing early cultivars as soon as rainfall has started from December onwards is currently proposed to give the best yields in this environment in most seasons. Increasing temperatures and declining rainfalls in all months of the year as a consequence of future climate change projections will substantially reduce grain yields. Under such conditions, sowing as early as October to avoid terminal water shortage and heat stress will minimise the negative impact from climate change. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Biophysical models that integrate information about crop growing conditions can give early insight about the likely size of a crop. At a point scale, where highly detailed knowledge about environmental and management conditions are known, the performance of reputable crop modelling approaches like APSIM have been well established. However, regional growing conditions tend not to be homogenous. Heterogeneity is common in many agricultural systems, and particularly in sugarcane systems. To overcome this obstacle, hundreds of model settings ('models' for convenience) that represent different environmental and management conditions were created for Ayr, a major sugarcane growing region in north eastern Australia. Statistical data mining methods that used ensembles were used to select and assign weights to the best models. One technique, called a lasso approximation produced the best results. This procedure, produced a predictive correlation (gamma(cv) of 0.71 when predicting end of season sugarcane yields some 4 months prior to the start of the harvest season, and 10 months prior to harvest completion. This continuous forecasting methodology based on statistical ensembles represents a considerable improvement upon previous research where only categorical forecast predictions had been employed.

A simulation study was carried out to assess the climate impact on the performance of a dryland wheat-fallow system and the potential value of seasonal climate forecasts in nitrogen management in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) of Australia. Daily climate data (1889-2002) from 57 stations were used with the agricultural systems simulator (APSIM) to simulate wheat productivity and nitrogen requirement as affected by climate. On a good soil, simulated grain yield ranged from {\textless} 2 t/ha in west inland to {\textgreater} 7 t/ha in the east border regions. Optimal nitrogen rates ranged from {\textless} 60 kgN/ha/yr to {\textgreater} 200 kgN/ha/yr. Simulated gross margin was in the range of -\$20/ha to \$700/ha, increasing eastwards. Wheat yield was closely related to rainfall in the growing season and the stored soil moisture at sowing time. The impact of stored soil moisture increased from southwest to northeast. Simulated annual deep drainage ranged from zero in western inland to {\textgreater} 200 mm in the east. Nitrogen management, optimised based on 'perfect' knowledge of daily weather in the coming season, could add value of \$26 similar to\$79/ha compared to management optimised based on historical climate, with the maximum occurring in central to western part of MDB. It would also reduce the nitrogen application by 5 similar to 25 kgN/ha in the main cropping areas. Comparison of simulation results with the current land use mapping in MDB revealed that the western boundary of the current cropping zone approximated the isolines of 160 mm of growing season rainfall, 2.5t/ha of wheat grain yield, and \$150/ha of gross margin in QLD and NSW. In VIC and SA, the 160-mm isohyets corresponded relatively lower simulated yield due to less stored soil water. Impacts of other factors like soil types were also discussed.},

	abstract = {The APSIM model was used to assess the impact of legumes on sorghum grown in rotation in a nutrient-limited system Under dry conditions in south-western Zimbabwe. An experiment was conducted at Lucydale, Matopos Research Station, between 2002 and 2005. The model was used to simulate soil and plant responses in the experiment. Sequences of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan), groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) were used in the rotations. Legumes accumulated up to 130 kg of N ha(-1) which was potentially available for uptake by sorghum in the following season. The APSIM model predicted total biomass, grain and N yields of the legume phase within the experimental error and performed well in predicting Sorghum yield and N supplied in the rotation after cowpea and groundnut. The model generally under-predicted sorghum total biomass and grain yield after pigeonpea. Observed patterns of crop water use, evaporative losses during the dry season and re-charge of soil profile at the start of the rainy season were generally well predicted by the model. An assessment of output oil sorghum N and water stresses in thee rotation indicated that the legume-cereal rotation is more driven by soil nitrogen availability than water availability even under semi-arid conditions. Further legume-cereal rotation analysis using the model will assist in the understanding of other processes in the rotations in dry environments. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	title = {Simulating rice in farming systems - modelling transitions between aerobic and ponded soil environments in {APSIM}},
	abstract = {Adapting farming systems to reduced availability of irrigation water is an emerging research issue in irrigated districts throughout the globe. Water shortages in parts of the rice-growing world have prompted research into a range of alternate agricultural practices, including expansion of rice as a component in diverse farming systems, in rotation with dryland and aerobically irrigated crops and pastures, utilising a range of modified tillage and residue management practices. Evaluation of potential future adaptation strategies can be assisted by well-tested farming systems models that capture interactions between soil water and nutrient dynamics, crop growth, climate and management inputs/practices. APSIM represents such a model, however due to its 'dryland heritage' APSIM has previously been unequipped to describe the soil water, carbon and nitrogen dynamics as soil environments progress from aerobic to anaerobic and back again, such as occurs in crop rotations involving ponded rice and other non-ponded crops (wheat, maize, legumes, pastures etc.). Various relevant chemical and biological processes that occur in long-term ponded water were also unaccounted for in APSIM. In this paper we describe how we incorporated this new functionality into APSIM. This includes evaluation of previous efforts to model anaerobic soil environments; conceptualization of the required new functionality within the existing APSIM framework; and design of code structure to facilitate seamless transitions between aerobic and anaerobic soil environments in continuous simulation. Included is the development of a new module, APSIM-Pond, to describe biological and chemical processes responsible for system loss/gain of C and N in rice ponds. We conclude by providing some preliminary testing results. As a starting point we use many process descriptions from the CERES-Rice and RIWER models. However a new element of APSIM-Pond is our representation of algal turnover and biomass soil incorporation in rice-based farming systems. This is in response to criticism of CERES-Rice's ability to capture long-term trends in soil organic carbon. In simulation of long-term (35 yrs +) ponded rice experiments at IRRI, CERES-Rice simulated a rundown in soil organic carbon, when in fact none was measured. We have included algal contributions to the C \& N pools in response to this criticism. No previous modelling framework has addressed the issue of switching between aerobic and anaerobic environments during a simulation, which is particularly important if the focus of the modelling exercise is evaluating new farming system practices that include ponded rice in rotation with non-flooded crops. The ORYZA2000 rice model was previously incorporated into APSIM, and tested in both N- and water-limited environments. This testing highlighted the needs for the improvements to the C \& N balances reported here. Similarly, the simulation of greenhouse gas emissions associated with changed practices in rice-based farming systems also requires sensible accounting for C \& N in pond and soil. To date, the model developmental work reported in this paper has focused on the soil C \& N story with respect to crop production - a future imperative will be partitioning modeled losses sensibly into the relevant greenhouse gases.},

	shorttitle = {Land-{Use} {Sequence} {Optimiser} ({LUSO})},
	abstract = {To grow beans, or not to grow beans, that is the question! Or in other words: how should I use this piece of land in front of me? This paper presents a preliminary design and implementation of a model called Land-Use Sequence Optimiser (LUSO). The model was designed to be a tool for finding optimal land-use sequences, with a particular focus on analysing the role of break crops within these optimal sequences. The model can also be used to analyse the sensitivity of optimal land-use sequences and the place of various break crops in these sequences to changes in model parameters. The focus of this paper is on describing the design concept and modelling approach used for LUSO and on showing how it can be used for analysing a problem, rather than giving details on parameterisations or results for particular cases. LUSO can be thought of as a state-and-transition model for valuing land-use sequences. It incorporates representations of weed biology and population dynamics, plant disease burden, soil nitrogen status, and a range of crop and management options. The model must be provided with a list of possible land-uses, each defined by a set of parameter values, and another set of 'general' parameter values that are not specific to a particular land-use. It is based on a one-year time step and assumes that every year is an 'average' year. The current version of the model represents a single land-use area, such as a paddock, and simulates how the state of this land-use area changes from year to year according to different land-uses. This model state includes representations of the number of seeds in the weed seed bank, and measures of disease burden and soil nitrogen status. The state is then used to predict the production and cost of the land use, which then provides an over-all long-term value for the land-use sequence. Several other routines and methods have been added to the basic land-use simulation - including optimisation and sensitivity analysis routines. The optimisation routines can be used to find answers to longer-term strategic questions, such as what is the optimal long-term sequence of crops to grow, or short-term tactical decisions, such as whether to harvest the crop that is currently being grown. The sensitivity analysis routines can be used to analyse how sensitive these answers are to various model parameters, which in turn allows an analysis of what factors are most important in choosing between tactical and strategic options. To illustrate these ideas, an example problem involving a tactical decision is presented; a farmer is faced with the decision between either harvesting a crop for immediate profit or sacrificing the crop and the immediate profit for longer-term benefits. A description of how LUSO was applied to analysing this problem is provided, together with sample output. I conclude the paper by pointing out that the strength of the LUSO modelling approach is its relative simplicity, transparency and efficiency. This means that it is relatively easy and quick to both adapt the model to address a new question, and then use the model to carry out the analysis. I also point out some directions where this approach could be usefully extended in future.},

	title = {An integrated approach to model the establishment, water use and growth of new perennial pasture species},
	abstract = {Perennial pastures increase the sustainability of Australian cropping systems by increasing out-of season water use, improving ground cover and helping to avoid dryland salinity. Medicago sativa (lucerne) is the most common perennial legume pasture and is adapted to a wide range of environments, but it does not persist well in areas with acid soils or low summer rainfall (Cocks 2001). Under these scenarios, native herbaceous perennial legumes, such as Cullen australasicum (Cocks 2001), and the exotic perennial pasture legume Bituminaria bituminosa var. albomarginata (common name albo-tedera) are potential alternatives to the currently limited perennial forage options. However, the growth and adaptability of these legumes to high-input Australian agricultural systems are likely to differ from currently used pasture species and their pasture potential has not been widely studied, tested or predicted. This paper describes the modelling of three aspects of the performance of these species, with the overall aim of predicting their performance across Australian agricultural areas. First, we quantified the early performance of these legumes, including early establishment and first summer survival, at three locations in the wheatbelt of Western Australia (WA): Buntine, Merredin and Newdegate. Lucerne was used as a reference. Initial analysis showed significant variability in their early adaptability and Principal Component Logistic Regression (PCLR) modelling revealed that temperature and a number of soil parameters (moisture, pH, available sulfur, available aluminium, conductivity and organic carbon) were all important in determining the early establishment and summer survival of these legumes under field conditions. Second, a mechanistic physiological growth model was developed to estimate the daily net photosynthesis based on light decay down the canopy (Thornley 2002). Respiration and senescence rates were incorporated in the model to estimate the daily biomass loss and thus daily net dry matter production was estimated. The influence of drought on leaf expansion and senescence was accounted for through the changes in soil water potential. Thermal time and soil water potential were used to simulate the leaf area index development under drought. Finally, crop phenology and growth parameters measured for the two species under a diverse range of soil and climatic conditions are being used to modify the existing Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) lucerne module to simulate B. bituminosa var. albomarginata and C. australasicum growth and production in APSIM. Once the models have been validated, they will be used to predict the performance of C. australasicum and B. bituminosa var. albomarginata under a wide range of environmental conditions in order to identify potentially suitable regions in WA, and across the country, for further trials and eventual adoption of these perennial pasture legumes. In addition, simulations will be done to predict future performance under expected climate change scenarios.},

	title = {Simulation of whole farm management decisions},
	abstract = {The simulation model APSFarm is an extended configuration of the systems model APSIM, and has been in development since 2005 to support the analysis of farm case studies in environments ranging from Central Queensland to the Victorian Riverina. One of the major extensions to APSIM was the implementation of dynamic farm management as a set of state transition networks, with each network representing the operation of a particular paddock or management unit. Each paddock has a current state (eg. fallow, crop), "rules" that allow transition to adjacent states, and "actions" that are taken when such a transition is made. These rules represent feasibility (eg. whether it is the correct planting season for this particular crop, whether machinery is available), tactics (eg fertiliser management), and strategy (eg. crop sequencing and mix of enterprise). Each day, the model examines all paths leading away from the current state to adjacent states. Should the mathematical product of all rules associated with a path be non-zero, the path becomes a candidate for action. Should more than one candidate be present, the highest ranking path is chosen, and its associated management actions to change state are undertaken (eg. sowing or harvesting a crop). There may be cascading events that flow from a state change, so the process is repeated until nothing more can be done for that day. The benefits of the network approach are multifold; gross patterns can be identified from the network structure that allows comparison between farmers and farm types. From a software perspective, details of the transition rules and their associated actions are readily accessible, instead of being encoded in complex logic code constructs. Encapsulating management strategy as a data structure instead of a series of specific instructions allows the construction of dynamic analysis tools in which complex decisions can be more clearly described as sets of simple and measurable rules of thumb. Further, this data structure can make the task of providing a cohesive user interface much easier, facilitating graphical representations of farm management. This paper presents a software tool used in studying diverse management systems drawn from ongoing case studies, discusses how the management systems are elucidated from farm managers and demonstrates some of the diagnostics available from such tools.},

	title = {Reflection plus {XML} {Simplifies} {Development} of the {APSIM} {Generic} {PLANT} {Model}},
	abstract = {The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) is a farming systems model that contains many sub-models. These sub models, in turn, contain many lines of legacy code that often need maintenance and refactoring. One model in APSIM that has undergone considerable reworking is the generic PLANT model, a model capable of simulating many crop species through parameterisation. Originally written in FORTRAN (Robertson et al. 2002, Wang et al. 2002), this model was converted to the C language and later restructured into classes using C++. This evolutionary process led to a model that was difficult to work with. More recently, newer computer languages have emerged that have the ability to return, at run-time, various metadata about the source code to a calling piece of code. This reflection, also called introspection, can be used by a model framework to make it more dynamic and able to respond to different types of models at runtime. For example, rather than using inheritance or an interface to locate and call a timestep method of a model, the infrastructure can analyse the model source code, looking for 'tags' that provide information about the appropriate method to call. These tags can also be used to describe the properties and methods of a model, allowing the infrastructure to provide values for them automatically. This can significantly reduce the amount of 'plumbing' code that the model developers must write. XML is another technology that can simplify the configuration and development of a model. In the APSIM generic PLANT model, it is used to select the desired processes to connect together to define a crop model and then to specify the parameters for those processes. The hierarchical nature of XML lends itself particularly well to this type of model specification. The APSIM PLANT model is reduced to a library of plant classes that describe the various organs and processes required to simulate the growth and development of many crop and tree species. Some of these processes are alternatives to other processes, for example, leaf development can be simulated as a whole of plant process or as cohorts of leaves. The selection of which approach to use for a particular crop is defined in the XML configuration file for that crop. This paper explores our use of reflection and XML in an attempt to simplify model development. These techniques aren't particularly new or novel in the software development industry, but their use in model development has been limited.},

	title = {Modelling the impacts of and adaptation responses to climate variability and change in {Australian} cropping systems},
	abstract = {In this paper we report on agronomic modelling of continuous cropping at seven sites across Australia, examining yield variations in response to climate conditions over the last fifty years and over the last ten years, and comparing these with potential yield variations under a possible future (2030) climate. In this approach we model a number of adaptation options nominated by farmers within the regions and examine the yield implications of including these options. The APSIM crop model was used to examine the impacts of climate variability and change on current and possible future yields at different cropping regions across Australia, and to examine regionally specific adaptation options in response to a moderate future climate change scenario. Two clear trends emerged from the comparison between recent (1998-2007) and long-term (1958-2007) yields: simulated median yields from Western Australia have fallen by an average of 24.7\% over the last ten years. A similar trend was modelled at one South Australian site. This decrease is largely in response to rainfall over the last ten years being near the lowest on record (CSIRO, 2007). In contrast, yield increases have been simulated at the remaining sites in South Australia (average median increase of 5.8\% above long-term estimates) and at the site in New South Wales (median increase of 15.3\% above the long-term estimate). This examination of impacts of climate change on future yields and of the effectiveness of nominated adaptation options revealed that further declines in yield may occur across all case study sites in response to further projected declines in rainfall. At most of the APSIM study sites the introduction of shorter growing season wheat varieties or changing from wheat to barley were not effective adaptation options to mitigate yield losses. However, introducing a fallow phase into a continuous wheat rotation served as an effective method to combat climate change related yield losses. Introducing a fallow into rotations under current climate conditions was also likely to increase productivity in some regions although implementation of this adaptation option will require cost-benefit analysis on a farm by farm basis. In a mixed cropping system under moderate climate warming removing higher risk crops such as canola from the rotation also proved an effective adaptation option.},

	title = {Modeling the response of wheat and maize productivity to climate variability and irrigation in the {North} {China} {Plain}},
	abstract = {The North China Plain (NCP) is the largest agricultural production area in China, accounting for about 50\% of wheat and 30\% of maize grain production in China, with a dominant wheat-maize double cropping system. Due to the concentrated summer monsoon rainfall and inter-annual climate variability, irrigation is required to support the high productivity of the wheat-maize system, especially for the wheat crop and in the northern part of the plain, where excessive use of ground-and surface water for irrigation has caused rapid decline of groundwater tables and severe reduction of available surface water from the Yellow River. The productivity of the double cropping system and its reliance on decreasing water supplies under the variable climate need to be assessed. There is still a lack of systematic studies on how the productivity of the wheat-maize system could respond to different levels of reduced irrigation water supply. A modeling approach is used in this study to analyze the response of wheat and maize productivity to climate variability and irrigation in the NCP. Firstly, we calibrated and evaluated the farming systems model APSIM for simulating the wheat-maize double cropping system with detailed field experiments conducted at three experimental sites (Luancheng, Yucheng and Fengqiu), which can represent the conditions of climate, soil and crop production in the NCP. The experiments covered 31 crop growing seasons, four genotypes of wheat and four of maize, and detailed measurements of leaf area index (LAI), above-ground biomass, grain yield, soil water and evapotranspiration (ET). The validated model was then applied to simulate the response of crop yield of the wheat-maize double cropping system to climate variability and irrigation water supply with historical climate data from 1961-2005 at Luancheng site. The APSIM model could explain 73\% of the variation in crop yield, with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.0 t ha(-1) for grain yield, 1.5 t ha(-1) for biomass and 1.3 m(2)/m(2) for LAI. The RMSD values of simulated soil water and ET were 24.3 and 1.5 mm, respectively. The results revealed that the APSIM model is able to capture the observed responses of crop growth, yield and water use of the wheat-maize double cropping systems to climate variability and irrigation management in the NCP. The simulated rain-fed wheat yield at Luncheng site ranged from 0 to 6.1 t ha(-1) and rain-fed maize yield ranged from 0 to 9.7 t ha(-1). Each 60 mm additional irrigation increased crop yield by 1.2 t ha(-1) and up to 540 mm irrigation would be required to achieve the yield potential of 7.1 t ha(-1) for wheat and 8.3 t ha(-1) for maize. If more than 180 mm water was available for irrigation, a partition of the water to maize would lead to higher total yield than applying it only to wheat.},

Impacts of individual changes in temperature, rainfall or CO(2) concentration as well as 2050 and 2070 climate change scenarios were analysed. Along the E-W transects, wheat yield at warmer and drier western sites were simulated to be more sensitive to temperature increase than cooler and wetter eastern sites; along the S-N transects, there were no significant difference in wheat yield response within 1-3 degrees C temperature increase. Along the E-W and S-N transects, wheat at drier sites would benefit more than wetter sites from elevated [CO(2)], but more sensitive to the decline in rainfall than in wetter sites. The increase in temperature only did not have much impact on water balance. Elevated [CO(2)] increased the drainage in all the sites, especially at drier sites. Rainfall reduction decreased evapotranspiration, runoff and drainage, especially at drier sites. In 2050, the most obvious increase of wheat yields under all climate change scenarios would occur at cooler and wetter sites (Yass and Young), ranging from 11.03\% to 18.01\%. The biggest loss occurred at the driest sites (Griffith and Swan hill) under A1FI and B2 scenarios, ranging from -6.34\% to -16.76\%. In 2070, there would be an increasing risk of yield loss in general, except for the cool and wet sites. Water use efficiency was simulated to increase at most of the study sites under all the climate change scenarios, except for the driest site.},

	abstract = {The present study set out to test the hypothesis through field and simulation studies that the incorporation of short-term summer legumes, particularly annual legume lablab (Lablab purpureus cv. Highworth), in a fallow-wheat cropping system will improve the overall economic and environmental benefits in south-west Queensland. Replicated, large plot experiments were established at five commercial properties by using their machineries, and two smaller plot experiments were established at two intensively researched sites (Roma and St George). A detailed study on various other biennial and perennial summer forage legumes in rotation with wheat and influenced by phosphorus (P) supply (10 and 40 kg P/ha) was also carried out at the two research sites. The other legumes were lucerne (Medicago sativa), butterfly pea (Clitoria ternatea) and burgundy bean (Macroptilium bracteatum). After legumes, spring wheat (Triticum aestivum) was sown into the legume stubble. The annual lablab produced the highest forage yield, whereas germination, establishment and production of other biennial and perennial legumes were poor, particularly in the red soil at St George. At the commercial sites, only lablab-wheat rotations were experimented, with an increased supply of P in subsurface soil (20 kg P/ha). The lablab grown at the commercial sites yielded between 3 and 6 t/ha forage yield over 2-3 month periods, whereas the following wheat crop with no applied fertiliser yielded between 0.5 to 2.5 t/ha. The wheat following lablab yielded 30\% less, on average, than the wheat in a fallow plot, and the profitability of wheat following lablab was slightly higher than that of the wheat following fallow because of greater costs associated with fallow management. The profitability of the lablab-wheat phase was determined after accounting for the input costs and additional costs associated with the management of fallow and in-crop herbicide applications for a fallow-wheat system. The economic and environmental benefits of forage lablab and wheat cropping were also assessed through simulations over a long-term climatic pattern by using economic (PreCAPS) and biophysical (Agricultural Production Systems Simulation, APSIM) decision support models. Analysis of the long-term rainfall pattern (70\% in summer and 30\% in winter) and simulation studies indicated that similar to 50\% time a wheat crop would not be planted or would fail to produce a pro. table crop (grain yield less than 1 t/ha) because of less and unreliable rainfall in winter. Whereas forage lablab in summer would produce a pro. table crop, with a forage yield of more than 3 t/ha, similar to 90\% times.

	title = {Potential to improve on-farm wheat yield and {WUE} in {Australia}},
	volume = {60},
	doi = {10.1071/CP09064},
	abstract = {Water-use efficiency (WUE) is defined here as the ratio of grain yield (kg/ha) to crop water use by evapotranspiration (mm). Much of the WUE literature has focussed on either the determination of the boundary of attainable WUE for any amount of available water, or on the practicalities of measurement of the WUE of a crop. While these are important issues for de. ning the gap between the attained and the potential WUE, little progress has been reported on clarifying the components that contribute to this gap or on how it can be bridged. To address these questions, we analysed 334 wheat fields for which we had the data necessary to both calculate WUE and to simulate crop growth and water use. Simulations were conducted through Yield Prophet (R), an on-line version of the APSIM systems model. For this dataset, evapotranspiration accounted for 69\% of observed yield variation, although the more commonly used growing-season (April-October) rainfall accounted for 50\%. Considering that evapotranspiration efficiency does not account for a wide range of potentially yield-limiting factors including soil and fertiliser nitrogen supply, crop phenology, and sowing dates, or rainfall distribution, these results reinforce the importance of evapotranspiration efficiency as a yield determinant for well managed crops in water-limited environments. WUE attained over the whole dataset was 15.2 kg grain/ha.mm (x-intercept = 67 mm), although this value contained data subsets with important differences in WUE based on soil water-holding capacity and regional diversity. Yield Prophet (R) simulated commercial wheat yields with RMSDs of 0.80t/ha (r(2) = 0.71), with some systematic error between observed and simulated yields. Simulated crops achieved a higher WUE(16.9 kg grain/ha.mm; x-intercept = 72 mm) than the observed crops, probably because APSIM does not account for effects of factors such as weeds, pests and diseases and impacts of severe weather. Simulated 'what-if' analysis suggested that further improvement in WUE may be achieved with an early sowing strategy or a higher nitrogen input strategy. A 'yield maximising' strategy that included an optimal plant density, early sowing date, and higher nitrogen inputs resulted in an average WUE (21.4 kg grain/ ha. mm; x- intercept = 80 mm) that is close to the previously reported (French-Schultz) boundary of WUE. This outcome suggests a great deal of scope for Australian wheat growers to adopt strategies that improve their WUE. Yield Prophet (R) farmers have already demonstrated significant improvement in on-farm WUE compared with previous studies. However, additional improvements will only be partially realised due to considerations of the cost: benefit ratio and risk in a highly variable climate, and the operational feasibility of these strategies with current technologies.},

	abstract = {Spatial variability in grain yield across a paddock often indicates spatial variation in soil properties, especially in regions like the Victorian Mallee. We combined 2 years of field data and 119 years of simulation experiments (APSIM-Wheat and APSIM-Barley crop models) to simulate crop yield at various levels of N application in 4 different management zones to explore the robustness of the zones previously determined for an experimental site at Birchip. The crop models explained 96\% and 67\% of the observed variability in wheat and barley grain yields, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 310 kg/ha and 230 kg/ha, respectively. The model produced consistent responses to the observed data from the field experiment in 2004 and 2005 where a high and stable yielding zone produced the highest dry matter as well as grain yield, while a low and variable zone recorded the lowest grain yield. However, from the long-term (119 years) simulation, the highest median wheat yield value was obtained on the low variable zone (2911 kg/ha) with high N fertiliser application, while the lowest was obtained on the high variable zone (851 kg/ha). Similarly, the highest barley yields (1880-3350 kg/ha) occurred on the low variable zone using the long-term simulation. In 10-20\% of years the highest yield occurred in the high-yielding zones, with the variable and stable zones changing rank with interactive behaviour only under early-sown conditions. Our analyses highlight the problem of using a limited range of seasons of different weather conditions in agronomy to make strategic conclusions as the long-term simulation did not confirm the original yield zone determination. The challenge ahead is to predict in advance the seasons where application of N fertiliser will be beneficial.},

	volume = {60},
	doi = {10.1071/CP09052},
	abstract = {Crop simulation models relevant to real-world agriculture have been a rationale for model development over many years. However, as crop models are generally developed and tested against experimental data and with large systematic gaps often reported between experimental and farmer yields, the relevance of simulated yields to the commercial yields of field crops may be questioned. This is the third paper in a series which describes a substantial effort to deliver model-based decision support to Australian farmers. First, the performance of the cropping systems simulator, APSIM, in simulating commercial crop yields is reported across a range of field crops and agricultural regions. Second, how APSIM is used in gaining farmer credibility for their planning and decision making is described using actual case studies. Information was collated on APSIM performance in simulating the yields of over 700 commercial crops of barley, canola, chickpea, cotton, maize, mungbean, sorghum, sugarcane, and wheat monitored over the period 1992 to 2007 in all cropping regions of Australia. This evidence indicated that APSIM can predict the performance of commercial crops at a level close to that reported for its performance against experimental yields. Importantly, an essential requirement for simulating commercial yields across the Australian dryland cropping regions is to accurately describe the resources available to the crop being simulated, particularly soil water and nitrogen. Five case studies of using APSIM with farmers are described in order to demonstrate how model credibility was gained in the context of each circumstance. The proposed process for creating mutual understanding and credibility involved dealing with immediate questions of the involved farmers, contextualising the simulations to the specific situation in question, providing simulation outputs in an iterative process, and together reviewing the ensuing seasonal results against provided simulations. This paper is distinct from many other reports testing the performance and utility of cropping systems models. Here, the measured yields are from commercial crops not experimental plots and the described applications were from real-life situations identified by farmers. A key conclusion, from 17 years of effort, is the proven ability of APSIM to simulate yields from commercial crops provided soil properties are well characterised. Thus, the ambition of models being relevant to real-world agriculture is indeed attainable, at least in situations where biotic stresses are manageable.},

	doi = {10.1071/CP09020},
	abstract = {In Australia, a land subject to high annual variation in grain yields, farmers find it challenging to adjust crop production inputs to yield prospects. Scientists have responded to this problem by developing Decision Support Systems, yet the scientists' enthusiasm for developing these tools has not been reciprocated by farm managers or their advisers, who mostly continue to avoid their use. Preceding papers in this series described the FARMSCAPE intervention: a new paradigm for decision support that had significant effects on farmers and their advisers. These effects were achieved in large measure because of the intensive effort which scientists invested in engaging with their clients. However, such intensive effort is time consuming and economically unsustainable and there remained a need for a more cost-effective tool. In this paper, we report on the evolution, structure, and performance of Yield Prophet (R) : an internet service designed to move on from the FARMSCAPE model to a less intensive, yet high quality, service to reduce farmer uncertainty about yield prospects and the potential effects of alternative management practices on crop production and income. Compared with conventional Decision Support Systems, Yield Prophet offers flexibility in problem definition and allows farmers to more realistically specify the problems in their fields. Yield Prophet also uniquely provides a means for virtual monitoring of the progress of a crop throughout the season. This is particularly important for in-season decision support and for frequent reviewing, in real time, of the consequences of past decisions and past events on likely future outcomes. The Yield Prophet approach to decision support is consistent with two important, but often ignored, lessons from decision science: that managers make their decisions by satisficing rather than optimising and that managers' fluid approach to decision making requires ongoing monitoring of the consequences of past decisions.},

	abstract = {Rainfall is the main driver of potential yield in the dryland cropping environment of Australia. Rainfall-based empirically derived models such as that proposed by French and Schultz (1984) (F\&S) can be used to determine an upper limit of water-limited potential yield, but F\&S often overestimates actual yield as it does not account for rainfall distribution, runoff, drainage, or stored soil water. More complex models are available to predict potential yield more accurately; however, farmers and advisors favour easy-to-use-methods to estimate potential yield. To derive a simple yet accurate method for estimating potential yield, several adjustments to F\&S were evaluated: (1) accounting for stored soil water at sowing, (2) varying the value of the intercept between yield and growing-season rainfall (GSR), (3) varying the water-use efficiency of the crops (WUE) according to soil type, and (4) adjustments to GSR depending on soil plant-available water capacity (PAWC). The water-limited potential yields predicted from these methods were compared with simulations from the daily time-step simulation model APSIM and observed wheat yields from 146 dryland wheat crops, managed to water-limited potential yield, covering the 1996-2006 seasons in the Mediterranean-type growing environments of Australia. The original F\&S method overestimated actual yields, particularly at high rainfall (GSR {\textgreater}220 mm) when PAWC was low, and underestimated yields at low rainfall (GSR {\textless}220 mm). Significant improvements to the F\&S were achieved with a few simple adjustments. With the addition of a variable intercept (dependent upon GSR), accounting for stored soil water at the start of the season and placing a cap on GSR that is a function of the soil PAWC, the predictive performance (RMSE 624 kg/ha) was similar to that gained with the daily time-step model APSIM (RMSE 419 kg/ha). The improved method gave more realistic estimates of water-limited potential yield, particularly at low and high rainfall and on soils of low PAWC.},

Assessment on yield risk and study on how to reduce yield risk by appropriate irrigations could provide suitable instructions for irrigation management and increasing yield. By using the simulation model APSIM, taking Beijing and Yucheng (Shandong) as case study areas, yield risk of winter wheat in those two areas were evaluated firstly. Then irrigation schemes were designed and their contributions to reduce yield risk in different rainfall years were analysed. In most years, rainfall could not meet the requirement of wheat, and in 30\% of years water shortage reached serious degree. In serious drought years, yields of winter wheat were only 2445 and 2466 kg/hm 2 in Beijing and Yucheng, respectively. After irrigation, yield risk was reduced greatly, while the appropriate irrigation schemes were varied in different rainfall year types. Synthetically considering reducing yield risk and increasing water use efficiency, three irrigations are appropriate to be given in serious and medium drought years at the stage of before sowing, jointing and flowering. For light drought years, two irrigations at the stage of before sowing and jointing, respectively, are sufficient to reduce yield risk as low as possible.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the value of using historical climate knowledge, Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and stored soil moisture at sowing time of wheat and canola crops to manage nitrogen application for increasing economic benefits from crop production and reducing drainage of farming systems at Walbundrie in Southeast Australia. The Agricultural Production System Simulator (APSIM) was used to simulate crop production and drainage passing the crop root zone in response to nitrogen application rates from 0 to 300 kgN ha(-1) year(-1) using historical climate records from 1889 to 2002. The skills of SOI phases to forecast growing season rainfall and crop yield were analysed. The impact of nitrogen management based on historical climate knowledge, SOI phases and stored soil moisture was assessed. The results showed that while the optimal N rate for maximum economic return was around 150 kgN ha(-1) year(-1) based on long-term average climatic conditions, it varied significantly from year to year depending on rainfall. Compared with current N application rate of 100 kgN ha(-1) year(-1) in the study region, the optimal N rate of 150 kgN ha-1 year(-1) derived from historical climate knowledge could lead to an increase of wheat gross margin by AU\$74 ha(-1) year(-1). The April to May SOI phases were useful predictors of growing season rainfall and grain yield of wheat and canola crops. The optimal N rates were 100, 150, 200 kgN ha(-1) year(-1) in the years when April/May SOI phases were falling/negative, near zero, and rising/positive, respectively. Based on such management, wheat gross margin was only increased by 2\%, 0\%, and 1\%, respectively, corresponding to a mean increase in gross margin of AU\$6 ha(-1), compared with N management at the optimal fixed N rate of 150 kgN ha(-1) year(-1). Stored soil water at sowing time (SSMS) showed positive correlation with crop yield. However, combining April/May SOI phases and SSMS to manage N application only increased wheat gross margin by AU\$8.8 ha(-1), and reduced deep drainage by 1.7 mm year(-1) for wheat, compared with N management based historical climate knowledge. Similar results were obtained for a continuous canola cropping system. Crown Copyright (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Detailed consideration of the complexities of agro-ecosystem components, and the interactions between these components, may be best approached with simulation modelling. We reviewed nine simulation models (APSIM, EcoMod, FASSET, GRAZPLAN, GPFARM, Hurley Pasture Model, IFSM, LINCFARM, and WFM) used primarily for research of grazing systems. GrassGro (one of the GRAZPLAN suite of decision support tools), LINCFARM, and WFM had particular strength in their simulation of animal production and farm management. The strengths of APSIM, EcoMod and FASSET lie in their simulation of soil nutrient dynamics, crop or pasture production and spatial variations in soil properties. The Hurley Pasture Model has particular capability to model nutrient cycling in the presence of climate change. The IFSM includes a comprehensive representation of machinery. GPFARM can be used to predict forage production of different plant functional groups. We suggest that more emphasis could be placed on including the effects of pests and diseases on pasture production and animal performance, more detailed representation of management practices, inclusion of more mechanistic voluntary feed intake and rumen processes and including the effect of specific genes and gene-by-environment interactions on plant quality and yields, nutrient use and animal performance. The Common Modelling Protocol, used in APSIM and the GRAZPLAN suite, may enable the development of a powerful and flexible pastoral agro-ecosystem model which incorporates newly developed modules of the nature mentioned above.},

Water allocation forecasts were then supplied to an irrigation simulation scheduling system to provide guidance about when and how much water could be applied. This research was underpinned by a cross-institutional collaboration that engaged industry, extension officers, engineers from the water authority and scientists from agriculture and climatology. The key findings from this investigation were 2-fold: the participatory approach (1) contributed to the development of information needed by industry, and (2) demonstrated the potential usefulness of climate forecasting models, hydrological models and cropping system simulators to contribute to enhancing knowledge about water availability and application.

	abstract = {In Mediterranean-type environments, the concentration of rainfall in winter months results in average winter rainfall that is in excess of evaporative demand. Cropping coarse textured soils in such regions results in a risk of drainage below the root zone, and associated with this, nutrient leaching. We used the APSIM-Nwheat simulation model to quantify the magnitude and variability of drainage and nitrate-N leaching under wheat crops for six locations and three soil types in the northern sandplain region of the Western Australian wheat belt and to assess the impact of varying crop management on drainage and leaching. Overall, the combination of a high concentration of rainfall in the winter months and coarse soil types resulted in a significant risk of drainage and leaching events of considerable magnitude even at the driest sites considered: the assumption that leaching and drainage are low in areas of low rainfall is an over-simplification. For some locations, simulated drainage was high, exceeding 100 turn for two locations on two soils; the sand and the acid loamy sand. Across the six locations considered, drainage was linearly related to average growing season rainfall. Leaching varied markedly between the soil types, with loamy sand having only one fifth the leaching that was calculated for the acid loamy sand or the sand. This emphasises the importance of small differences in soil type for the risk of drainage and leaching, and hence the potential for negative off-site effects, when cropping light soils in a Mediterranean-type environment. Although sandy soils are held to present the most scope for reducing drainage through agronomic management, the analysis suggested the potential improvements are likely to be small. Consistent with experimental results from other parts of the Western Australian wheat belt, modification of rooting depth appears to present the best. option to reduce drainage beneath annual crops.

	abstract = {The efficiency with which applied resources are utilized in sub-Saharan African cropping systems is especially critical as the resources are generally scarce. Research efforts to improve farm productivity increasingly focus on resource interactions and trade-offs operating at farm-scale. Farm-scale models that integrate summary models of the various subsystems (crops, livestock, household) are proposed to analyse the complexity of management systems. NUANCES-FIELD is a summary model of the crop/soil system that calculates seasonal crop production based on resource availability, capture and utilization efficiencies. A detailed mechanistic crop growth model, APSIM, was used to generate parameters and variables that can be introduced as descriptive functions in NUANCES-FIELD. To such end, we first parameterized and tested APSIM based on several field experiments carried out on different soil types in western Kenya farms where nitrogen and/or phosphorus were applied. The model was further configured to generate nitrogen and phosphorus response curves as a function of soil condition (carbon content, clay content, phosphorus-sorption characteristics) and the effects of alternative weed management scenarios in relation to labour availability. Nitrogen, phosphorus and rainfall capture efficiencies ranged between 0.22-0.85 kg kg(-1), 0.05-0.29 kg kg(-1) and 0.10-0.53 mm mm(-1), respectively, depending on soil nutrient and physical conditions. Variation in the integrated seasonal fraction of radiation intercepted (intFRINT) with plant density was adequately described by the function y = 0.058x + 0.11 within a range of 1.5-5.5 maize plants per m(2). Investigation of weed management using the APSIM model identified a weed-free period of at least five weeks from maize emergence for minimum yield loss from weed-crop competition. The simulation exercises confirmed that resource-use efficiencies sharply decrease on moving from relatively fertile fields 'close' to the homestead towards degraded 'remote' fields within the same farm, giving impetus to expedite the search for better targeted management strategies for spatially-heterogeneous farms.

	abstract = {Excessive drainage of water beyond the root zone of agricultural plants is complicit in causing extensive dryland salinity in southern Australia. Opportunistically sowing summer forage crops within winter cereal rotations could be a flexible means of reducing this deep drainage whilst achieving additional livestock production. A simulation-based feasibility study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of summer forage cropping in altering the water balance and to predict any adverse effects on winter crop yield. At the study location in southern New South Wales an average of 37\% of the 557 mm annual rainfall falls outside wheat growing season, i.e., in the summer fallow period. Summer cowpea. crops planted in the fallow period were predicted to yield 1.3 t/ha of biomass on average (range of 0-5.7 t/ha) if sown every year. Crops failed to establish in 1 year out of 5, and predicted yield failed to exceed 1.0 t/ha in 52\% of years. Compared with a wheat-fallow scenario, the wheat-cowpea systems increased evapotranspiration outside the wheat growing season by up to 40\% depending on surnmercrop frequency. Continuous wheat-cowpea cropping reduced deep drainage by 62\% but also reduced yields of following wheat crops by 13\%. Opportunistic summer cropping was less effective than continuous summer cropping in terms of total deep drainage reduction but produced more biomass per crop sown, and incurred smaller yield penalties on wheat. The simulation results suggest that opportunistic summer forage cropping is effective in reducing deep drainage and, compared to luceme phase farming systems, offers greater management flexibility and smaller winter crop yield penalties. Further studies are needed on the practicality and economic benefit of the proposed summer forage cropping. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Hypothetical forecasts of categories of seasonal rainfall (May-October) were evaluated in order to identify which requirements for seasonal climate forecasting are most useful in guiding decisions on both nitrogen (N) fertiliser rates, and whether or not to sow wheat, at different sites in the Mediterranean region of Western Australia. The analyses included the identification of the required number of forecast categories and their boundaries, and the quantification of effects of forecast skill (from zero to perfect) on the potential value of categorical forecasts. Simulated data from the APSIM-NWheat model were used to calculate gross margins for three soil types (clay, loam, sand) at four locations. The value of the hypothetical forecast information was calculated in terms of the additional gross margin achieved over strategies which ignore any forecasts (a "naive forecast"). In order for the conditional distribution (based on a forecast) of gross margins to differ from the all-years distribution (based on a naive forecast) at p {\textless}= 0.1, a minimum of two categories (below/above median rain) were required at the low rainfall sites Merredin and Buntine, while at the medium rainfall sites Wongan Hills and Mingenew three categories (rainfall terciles) were required. This distribution shift was significant only on the clay soil, with exception to the loam at Merredin. With a conditional N management on the clay, the average gross margin increased by 31 AUD ha(-1) (+104\%) at Merredin and 40 AUD ha-1 (+40\%) at Buntine when a perfect two-category forecast (below/above median) was assumed. With a perfect threecategory forecast (terciles) the average increase was 62 AUD ha-1 (+20\%) at Wongan Hills and 60 AUD ha-1 (+18\%) at Mingenew. There was no additional benefit in adjusting N fertiliser rates based on forecasts of extreme categories (i.e. the 1st, 2nd,... 8th, 9th rainfall decile) compared to forecasts of either above/below median or terciles. The minimum level of skill required for two- and three-category forecasts to be potentially valuable increased with seasonal rainfall, and was higher for a flexible than for a fixed sowing strategy. With fixed sowing on the clay soil, the threshold skill level was 13\% at Merredin and 26\% at Buntine in a two-category format; and 52\% at Wongan Hills and 56\% at Mingenew in a three-category format. At moderate levels of skill, the application of forecasts returned value at the low rainfall sites only. Given a three-categor forecast with a hypothetical skill of 40\%, the value was 15 AUD ha(-1) when used to modify N fertiliser rates on the clay at the dry site Merredin. The same forecast had no value at the wet site Mingenew. Crown Copyright (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Management decisions, such as subsoil liming or varying fertilizer inputs to take account of soil depth and anticipated yields require knowledge of where subsoil constraints to root growth occur across the field. We used selected yield maps based on criteria derived from crop simulation, apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa), gamma-ray emission maps and a soil type map drawn by the grower to predict the spatial distribution of subsoil acidity and shallow soil across a field. Yield maps integrate the effects of variation in soil and climate, and it was only under specific seasonal conditions that subsoil constraints depressed yields. We used crop simulation modelling to select yield maps with a large information content on the spatial distribution of these constraints and to omit those with potentially misleading information. Yield and other spatial data layers were used alone or in combination to develop subsoil mapping options to accommodate differences in data availability, access to precision agriculture techniques and the grower's aptitude and preference. One option used gamma-ray spectrometry and EM38 survey as a dual-sensing system to improve data interpretation. Gamma-ray spectrometry helped to overcome the inability of current ECa-based methods to sense soil depth in highly weathered sandy soil over cemented gravel. A feature of the approaches presented here is the use of grower and agronomist knowledge, and experience to help interpret the spatial data layers and to evaluate which approach is most suitable and likely to be adopted to suit an individual.},

	abstract = {Physiological and genetic studies of leaf growth often focus on short-term responses, leaving a gap to whole-plant models that predict biomass accumulation, transpiration and yield at crop scale. To bridge this gap, we developed a model that combines an existing model of leaf 6 expansion in response to short-term environmental variations with a model coordinating the development of all leaves of a plant. The latter was based on: (1) rates of leaf initiation, appearance and end of elongation measured in field experiments; and (2) the hypothesis of an independence of the growth between leaves. The resulting whole-plant leaf model was integrated into the generic crop model APSIM which provided dynamic feedback of environmental conditions to the leaf model and allowed simulation of crop growth at canopy level. The model was tested in 12 field situations with contrasting temperature, evaporative demand and soil water status. In observed and simulated data, high evaporative demand reduced leaf area at the whole-plant level, and short water deficits affected only leaves developing during the stress, either visible or still hidden in the whorl. The model adequately simulated whole-plant profiles of leaf area with a single set of parameters that applied to the same hybrid in all experiments. It was also suitable to predict biomass accumulation and yield of a similar hybrid grown in different conditions. This model extends to field conditions existing knowledge of the environmental controls of leaf elongation, and can be used to simulate how their genetic controls flow through to yield.},

	doi = {10.1002/joc.1520},
	abstract = {With increased investment in improving climate forecasting techniques, it is essential to find ways of quantifying the maximum benefit of climate forecasts for a given industry. This paper describes an approach to quantify the value of 'perfect' climate forecasts to direct nitrogen management in a wheat-cropping system at two Australian locations with contrasting annual rainfall. For annual wheat-cropping systems, and compared with the N management based on optimal N rate derived from long-term climatic conditions, N management based on 'perfect' climate forecasts can lead to an average benefit of \$65.2/ha/year at Walbundrie (annual rainfall 560.0 mm) and \$66.5/ha/year at Wanbi (annual rainfall 314.5 mm). Generally, the economic benefit is highest in extreme (wet and dry) years and lowest in normal years. At the high rainfall site Walbundrie, where average N-application rate is high, the maximum yearly benefit was from significant saving through reduction in N application in driest years. At the low rainfall site Wanbi, where average N rates are low, the highest benefit was from both yield increases in the wettest years and saving of management and fertilizer cost in the driest years. Such optimized nitrogen management has little impact on excess drainage, but it can have significant impact on reduction of excess nitrogen, especially in high rainfall areas. An excess N reduction of 1314 kg N/ha at Wanbi and 1538 kg N/ha at Walbundrie can be achieved in 114 years. The significant reduction in N excess at Walbundrie may have profound environmental implications. Copyright (c) 2007 Royal Meteorological Society.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.fcr.2007.08.003},
	abstract = {Wheat grain yields, grain protein and grain size are often variable in a Mediterranean-type environment due to large rainfall variability. Grain yields are often low due to low N inputs as a result of large uncertainties of rainfall, particularly during the latter part of the season. Larger amounts of N fertiliser might increase yields and also grain protein in such environments but could have negative effects on grain size. A systems analysis approach was taken, using the APSIM-Nwheat crop model, to assess potential yield, grain protein concentration and grain size of wheat across a range of conditions. Rainfall and temperature varied with location. Soil type, different amounts of initial stored water and a range of management options, including varying sowing dates and N fertiliser applications, were also considered. In Australia, penalties for small grain size are based on 'screenings': the percentage of grain to pass through a 2 mm sieve. A new routine was developed for the model describing the relationship between screenings percentage and average simulated grain size. At low rainfall locations, 30 mm of plant-available soil water at seeding gave a significant increase in grain yield ({\textgreater} 20\%) above that for no soil water. At high rainfall locations there was little effect ({\textless} 7\%). Three typical coarse textured soils had similar yields at low N supplies but soils with higher plant-available water-holding capacity responded more to N applications and thus at high N applications achieved higher grain yields. Above average rainfall from May to September in combination with below average temperatures resulted in the highest simulated yields. However, seasons with an average amount of in-seasonal rainfall but with rainfall well distributed throughout the season also had above average yields. Applications of small amounts of N (30 kg N/ha) caused a slight reduction in grain protein concentration, but higher N applications ({\textgreater} 30 kg N/ha) resulted in increased protein and screenings. Nevertheless, with moderate N (60 kg N/ha) applications and early sowing, the proportion of years with low grain protein ({\textless} 10\%) and low screenings ({\textless} 2\%) was still more than two-thirds. Simulated average yields of a location increased with average rainfall but declined with increasing average temperature of a location. This allowed the development of a simple rule of thumb in which average grain yields can be related to the rainfall/temperature index of a location. The simulation analysis showed that there is potential to increase current farmer yields through higher and split N applications on light soils in Mediterranean-type environments without increasing average screenings above 3\%. However, grain protein concentrations are likely to be low in most seasons on low water-holding soils. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A simulation study was made on the response of plant-type and nitrogen fertilization on the yield of pearl millet in Rajasthan, India. A model of the pearl millet crop (APSIM-Millet) was tested against experimental and district data and was shown to be responsive to applied nitrogen and to varied weather conditions with and without applied nitrogen in the region. The simulation study employed both observed (14-34 years between 1963 and 1997) and synthetic (50 years) daily weather data in a comparative analysis that showed little difference in conclusions if either data sequence were used. The probability analyses showed a strong plant-type, nitrogen and site effect in response to variation in weather (observed or synthetic). At Pali and Jodhpur choice of cultivar made a large yield difference with a strong interaction with nitrogen. In terms of median response, highest yield was achieved with cultivar RCB-IC911 (median 800 kg ha -1) followed by cultivar HHB67 (median 613 kg ha -1) with the lowest consistent yield from cultivar WRajPop (median 500 kg ha -1). At Bikaner and Jaisalmer cultivar response was much smaller than at the wetter sites but generally the same order of response was seen. Similarly, the response to nitrogen was greatest at Pali and Jodhpur; moreover, the nitrogen response was generally larger than the cultivar response, despite the negative effect in dry conditions at Pali. Thus, at these wetter sites significant yield increases (e.g. 700-900 kg ha -1) above what is currently achieved with unfertilized landraces are likely with the combination of an improved cultivar and application of N fertilizer. Even at the drier site at Bikaner, yields could be more than doubled (from 250 to 550 kg ha -1) with improved cultivars and N fertilizer application. However, at Jaisalmer, improved cultivars and N fertilizer application could not be economically justified. Significant benefits are likely from an integrated approach to plant breeding and agronomy in these semi-arid regions of India and Africa where N deficiency is endemic.},

	abstract = {Reliable seasonal climate forecasts are needed to aid tactical crop management decisions in south-eastern Australia (SEA). In this study we assessed the quality of two existing forecasting systems, i.e. the five phases of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and a three phase Pacific Ocean sea-surface temperatures (SSTs), to predict spring rainfall (i.e. rainfall from 1 September to 31 November), and simulated wheat yield. The quality of the forecasts was evaluated by analysing four attributes of their performance: their reliability, the relative degree of shift and dispersion of the distributions, and measure of forecast consistency or skill. Available data included 117 years of spring rainfall and 104 years of grain yield simulated using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model, from four locations in SEA. Average values of spring rainfall were 102-174 mm with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 47\%. Average simulated wheat yields were highest (5609 kg/ha) in Albury (New South Wales) and lowest (1668 kg/ha) in Birchip (Victoria). The average CV for simulated grain yields was 36\%. Griffith (NSW) had the highest yield variability (CV= 50\%). Some of this year-to-year variation was related to the El Ni (n) over tilde no Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Spring rainfall and simulated wheat yields showed a clear association with the SOI and SST phases at the end of July. Important variations in shift and dispersion in spring rainfall and simulated wheat yields were observed across the studied locations. The forecasts showed good reliability, indicating that both forecasting systems could be used with confidence to forecast spring rainfall or wheat yield as early as the end of July. The consistency of the forecast of spring rainfall and simulated wheat yield was 60-83\%. We concluded that adequate forecasts of spring rainfall and grain yield could be produced at the end of July, using both the SOI and SST phase systems. These results are discussed in relation to the potential benefit of making tactical top-dress applications of nitrogen fertilisers during early August.},

The objective of this study was to identify homoclimes (i.e. similar chickpea-growing environments) in the major chickpea-growing areas of the 2 countries, using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) chickpea model. The model, which processes climatic, soil, and plant information on a daily time step, was first validated and then used to simulate flowering, maturity, and grain yield of Amethyst, a mid-season cultivar, and Barwon, a full-season cultivar, on low (100 mm), medium (150 mm), and high (190 mm) water-holding capacity soils, using historical climatic data of 67 Australian and 24 Indian locations. The mean of annual outputs of flowering, maturity, and grain yield of the 2 cultivars on 3 soils was then clustered using Ward's hierarchical complete linkage clustering procedure. At a 90\% level of similarity, all the locations could be grouped into 6 homoclime clusters. The Australian locations appeared more diverse as they were present in all the clusters, whereas the Indian locations were present only in clusters 1, 2, and 6. While there were clear geographical patterns of spread of these clusters, in Australia they were not entirely related to latitude. The cluster 1 and 2 locations, which represent the largest chickpea-growing area in Australia, had homoclime locations in common with northern India. The clustering of locations appeared generally consistent with the known adaptation of chickpea in different environments of the 2 countries and therefore suggests that the methodology could be potentially used for complementing conventional approaches of introducing or exchanging germplasm, as well as determining appropriateness of breeding/testing sites.},

	abstract = {Demand for water in Australia is increasing along with growing pressure to maximise the efficiency of irrigation water use and seek additional and alternative irrigation supplies. The scarcity of water supplies coupled with the need for urban communities to dispose of large quantities of treated recycled water from sewage treatment plants has led to increasing interest from urban and rural communities in the reticulation of this water for irrigating adjacent crop-production areas. Proposals to use recycled water inevitably lead to a complex range of issues that need to be addressed, including: costs and benefits of supplying an additional source of water to current or new cropping systems; optimum irrigation design and management, particularly where there are multiple sources of irrigation water; management of overflow from on-farm water storages; and environmental implications with regard to salinity, runoff, drainage, nitrate leaching, and environmental flows. Simulation models can capture many of the key factors and processes influencing irrigated crop production systems, and can play a useful role in exploring these issues. In this paper, we have described an approach that couples agricultural production system and economic models in a way that enables analysis of the likely benefits and risks of investing in recycled water, although the analysis is equally relevant to any assessment of the value of an additional source of irrigation water, particularly saline water. The approach has been illustrated with a case study of a mixed-crop farm in the Darling Downs region of Queensland, Australia, in which the farm-scale crop production, economic, and environmental implications of investing in recycled water were considered.},

It uses a high yielding (17400 kg/ha dry grain, 20500 kg/ha at 15\% water) commercial crop grown in 2004-05 as the basis of the study. Yield for the agronomic and environmental conditions of 2004-05 was predicted accurately, giving confidence that the model could be used for the detailed analyses undertaken. The analysis showed that the yield achieved was close to that possible with the conditions and agronomic inputs of 2004-05. Sowing dates during 21 September to 26 October had little effect on predicted yield, except when combined with reduced temperature. Single year and long-term analyses concluded that a higher plant population (11 plants/m(2)) is needed to optimise yield, but that slightly lower N and irrigation inputs are appropriate for the plant population used commercially (8.4 plants/m(2)). Also, compared with changes in agronomic inputs increases in temperature and/or radiation had relatively minor effects, except that reduced temperature reduces predicted yield substantially. This study provides an approach for the use of models for both retrospective analysis of crop performance and assessment of long-term variability of crop yield under a wide range of agronomic and environmental conditions.},

After testing the model against three seasons of experimental data, simulation experiments using different irrigation strategies were conducted across a range of plant populations ranging from 20000 to 80000 plants/ha, on two soil types with plant available water capacities (PAWC) of 146 mm and 220 mm. All soil type x plant population x irrigation strategy scenarios were simulated using the historical climate record for Dalby from 1889 to 2004, in order to obtain long-term average yield and gross margins (LGM) for each scenario. Soil water was reset to two-thirds of PAWC at sowing in each year. Plant populations required to achieve maximum LGMs ranged from 50000 to 80000 plants/ha across the range of scenarios, and were higher than currently recommended by district agronomists for partially irrigated maize. The use of higher plant populations increased season-to-season variability in grain yield and gross margins and may not be a suitable strategy for growers who do not want to increase their risk of crop failure. Partially irrigated maize achieved substantially higher gross margins in years where a positive Southern Oscillation Index phase was recorded in August, and the use of higher plant populations in such years also increased long-term profitability, but also increased the risk of crop failure. Economic gains were achieved by varying the timing and amount of irrigation within a limited available irrigation volume, with a single 100 mm irrigation giving greater LGMs than two 50 mm irrigation events on both soil types, when the irrigation events were scheduled to fill a soil water deficit equal to the effective irrigation volume. However, under full irrigation the use of smaller irrigation volumes increased LGMs on the 146 mm PAWC soil, demonstrating the importance of timely irrigation scheduling on low PAWC soils.},

Growing hybrids with very early maturity provides a possible way to achieve this. Simulation studies of dryland maize production in areas of highly variable rainfall in north-east Australia were undertaken using long-term weather data input to the APSIM model configured for quick to medium maturity maize. The studies focussed on sowing time options, population density, cultivars, and water availability at sowing. Simulation outputs included predicted mean and median yield, measures of yield variability, and the probability of producing low to very low yield ({\textless} 2 t/ha). The study showed that optimum sowing date varied with location, and that low populations gave more reliable production, despite some potential yield losses in favourable years. The results of the simulation study provide estimates of yield and thus economic viability of maize production that are interpreted in terms of seasonal variability. They indicate that maize is a viable dryland cropping option provided that cultivar, sowing time and starting water conditions are optimised. Non-optimal conditions of water supply at sowing should be avoided, as greater variability in yield and reduced viability are predicted.},

Modelling of interactions between host plant and environment during the season can enable quantification of preharvest aflatoxin risk and its potential management. A model was developed to quantify climatic risks of aflatoxin contamination in maize using principles previously used for peanuts. The model outputs an aflatoxin risk index in response to seasonal temperature and soil moisture during the maize grain filling period using the APSIM's maize module. The model performed well in simulating climatic risk of aflatoxin contamination in maize as indicated by a significant R-2 (P = 0.01) between aflatoxin risk index and the measured aflatoxin B1 in crop samples, which was 0.69 for a range of rainfed Australian locations and 0.62 when irrigated locations were also included in the analysis. The model was further applied to determine probabilities of exceeding a given aflatoxin risk in four non-irrigated maize growing locations of Queensland using 106 years of historical climatic data. Locations with both dry and hot climates had a much higher probability of higher aflatoxin risk compared with locations having either dry or hot conditions alone. Scenario analysis suggested that under non-irrigated conditions the risk of aflatoxin contamination could be minimised by adjusting sowing time or selecting an appropriate hybrid to better match the grain filling period to coincide with lower temperature and water stress conditions.},

This paper describes, the development and usage of two specific products; WhopperCropper and APSFarm. WhopperCropper facilitates simulation-aided discussion of growers' exposure to risk when comparing alternative crop input options. The user can readily generate 'what-if' scenarios that separate the major influences whilst holding other factors constant. Interactions of the major inputs can also be tested. A manager can examine the effects of input levels (and Southern Oscillation Index phase) to broadly determine input levels that match their attitude to risk. APSFarm has been used to demonstrate that management changes can have different effects in short and long time periods. It can be used to test local advisors and farmers' knowledge and experience of their desired rotation system. This study has shown that crop type has a larger influence than more conservative minimum soil water triggers in the long term. However, in short term dry periods, minimum soil water triggers and maximum area of the various crops can give significant financial gains.},

	abstract = {APSIM and CERES - sorghum models were calibrated by using the data collected from the field experiments conducted at Centre for Rabi sorghum, Solapur, Maharashtra and from the farmer's fields of Solapur district. For APSIM, rabi sorghum data of M35-1 (popularly grown cultivar of the region) under different dates of sowing in different years (2001 - 2004) was used. For CERES data of rabi 2005-06 and rabi 2006-07 on phenology and yield were used. The APSIM model has predicted the grain yield with deviation of 1.3 \% to 7.0 \% and -0.3\% to -1.1\% during rabi 2001 and 2002 at CRS, Solapur. Because of late receipt of rains during the years 2003 and 2004, the sowings were delayed and the model over predicted the yields with a deviation of 10.4 \% to 23.1 \%. CERES model simulation results revealed that for normal sowing, the model predicted the yield with deviation of 6.2 \% to 26.7 \% and 7.3 \% to 9.3 \% for the years 2005 and 2006, respectively. CERES model under predicted the flowering of M 35-1 with deviation of -8.8\% to 11.8\%. Whereas, the maturity was predicted with deviation of -7-11\% to 2.7\%.},

	doi = {10.1007/s11104-007-9316-3},
	abstract = {Subsoil constraints to root growth exacerbate frequent water and nutrient limitations to crop yields in Mediterranean-type environments. Amelioration of subsoil constraints can relieve these limitations by opening root-access to subsoil water and nutrients. However, decisions in subsoil amelioration are hampered by seasonally variable yield responses in these environments. We used the APSIM model to analyse the impact of subsoil constraints on yield and yield variability. The simulated yield data were used to calculate the financial benefits of subsoil amelioration across several scenarios. There was a strong yield-dependence on accessible soil water governed by root depth. Root depth development was limited to a minimum of either the effect of subsoil constraints or the weather-dependent depth of the soil wetting front. Insufficient rainfall in dry years or in a drier region often resulted in shallow soil wetting fronts and correspondingly shallow roots even in the absence of subsoil compaction. In these situations, there is little response to subsoil amelioration. Positive yield responses and positive financial returns to subsoil amelioration are therefore greater in good rainfall years and are more likely in a wetter region. A yield response to amelioration is also greater in coarser textured sand than finer textured sandy loam in an average rainfall season because the same amount of rainfall results in a deeper wetting front in sand than in sandy loam. Hence, roots in a sand are required to grow deeper compared to a sandy loam to access the same amount of water and therefore benefited more from subsoil amelioration in an average rainfall year. In wet years, sands leach more nitrate than sandy loam, which decreases yields and the response to subsoil amelioration in sands is more than in the sandy loam. Environmental threats occur along with yield loss when roots cannot access subsoil water. These include increased nitrate leaching and deep drainage due to unused water remaining in the soil profile. By allowing roots to access deep soil water, ameliorating subsoil is expected to yield financial gains in average to good rainfall seasons and decrease the environmental risk of drainage and leaching loss. The financial gains are expected to offset potential financial losses in dry and dry finish seasons especially in coarser textured soils and wetter environment.},

	abstract = {An accurate and management sensitive simulation model for tile-drained Midwestern soils is needed to optimize the use of agricultural management practices (e.g., winter cover crops) to reduce nitrate leaching without adversely affecting corn yield. Our objectives were to enhance the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) for tile drainage, test the modified model for several management scenarios, and then predict nitrate leaching with and without winter wheat cover crop. Twelve years of data (1990-2001) from northeast Iowa were used for model testing. Management scenarios included continuous corn and corn-soybean rotations with single or split N applications. For 38 of 44 observations, yearly drain flow was simulated within 50 nun of observed for low drainage ({\textless} 100 mm) or within 30\% of observed for high drain flow. Corn yield was simulated within 1500 kg/ha for 12 of 24 observations. For 30 of 45 observations yearly nitrate-N loss in tile drains was simulated within 10 kg N/ha for low nitrate-N loss ({\textless}20 kg N/ha) or within 30\% of observed for high nitrate-N loss. Several of the poor yield and nitrate-N loss predictions appear related to poor N-uptake simulations. The model accurately predicted greater corn yield under split application (140-190 kg N/ha) compared to single 110 kg N/ha application and higher drainage and nitrate-N loss under continuous corn compared to corn/soybean rotations. A winter wheat cover crop was predicted to reduce nitrate-N loss 38\% (341 vs. 537 kg N/ha with and without cover) under 41-years of corn-soybean rotations and 150 kg N/ha applied to corn. These results suggest that the modified APSIM model is a promising tool to help estimate the relative effect of alternative management practices under fluctuating high water tables.

	title = {Economic impact of water stress on sugar production in {Australia}},
	volume = {25},
	abstract = {The assessment of drought on crop production is complicated by the difficulty in defining the conditions that constitute both 'normal' and 'drought' situations. In the sugar industry, the matter is further complicated by drought mitigation with irrigation which can vary substantially from year to year. Taking current levels of irrigation into account, this paper assesses the economic impact of water stress on sugar production in the major cane growing regions of Australia, in order to evaluate the merits of breeding for drought resistance and improved water use efficiency. The approach taken in this study was to use the crop simulation model APSIM-Sugarcane to account for historical yields for a number of regions. Having explained up to 60 \% of the variation in past yields, achievable yields without water limitation could then be estimated. After considering the contribution of each region to the annual Australian cane crop, a mean water stress factor of 0.867 was obtained, indicating that with adequate water and all other factors non-limiting, the maximum that yields could be improved is about 15\%. Total annual sugar production in 2002 to 2004 was 5.0 to 5.5 m tonnes. Assuming a 5 m tonne annual production and a pool sugar price of \$300, this theoretical yield improvement is worth \$230 million per annum. The estimated revenue loss due to water stress varied considerably from year to year and from region to region. For instance, revenue losses since 1992 were greatest in Mackay during the peak drought years of 2002 to 2004, exceeding \$90 million per annum at the current pool sugar price. This study provides an objective assessment of the cost of water stress to the industry in order to judge the value of breeding for drought tolerance and improved water use efficiency. The feasibility of doing this will need to be assessed thoroughly.},

	abstract = {During the 1990s, a soils database was developed by the International Soil Reference and Information Centre in The Netherlands for the project "World Inventory of Soil Emission Potentials" (WISE). Using this database, we converted 1125 soil profiles from around the world into a format that can be used as input data to some commonly used biophysical computer models, such as the crop simulation models within the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT). Soil data are often unavailable, particularly for many locations in the tropical and subtropical regions. If little or nothing is known about the soil profile for a particular location, a soil database can be used to estimate some of its parameters, based on a comparison with other soils from the same region. The WISE database is one of the most comprehensive soil databases, with samples well distributed in the World. The resulting soil profile can then be used as input parameters for a model to simulate growth, development and yield for one or more crops for this location. With multiple profiles available for many soil classes, it is possible to obtain an indication about the range of values for each soil parameter and then conduct an uncertainty analysis with respect to the model's response to this range. All soil profiles have been geo-referenced, and can thus be linked to the digital version of the FAO-UNESCO soil map of the world. We describe the methods used to convert the soil profile database, discuss the variability of key soil variables by soil class, illustrate how the database can be used, and conclude with recommendations for further work to improve the database for biophysical modeling applications.

While simple water balance models have been effective in estimating soil water deficit, such models cannot differentiate between the different water loss mechanisms. More complex water-transport models include the ability to predict the flow of water and nutrients through mole-tile drainage systems but none have yet been applied, or tested, under New Zealand conditions. Here we test such a model against existing data. The simulation model APSIM was used to estimate soil water extraction by pasture, slow drainage through the fragipan, mole-tile drainage, surface runoff, and evaporation from the soil surface of the Tokomaru silt loam. Soil hydraulic properties were derived from the literature. Comparison was made against previously published data on soil water deficit, tile drainage, and surface runoff. APSIM's predictions of soil water deficit compared well against much of the available data. The exception to this was during a period of exceptionally dry soil conditions when the model predicted a lower soil water deficit than indicated by the data. There was excellent agreement between the simulated and measured drainage, as well as reasonable agreement of measured and modelled surface runoff on a cumulative basis, although there was some deviation when considered on an event basis.},

	abstract = {The performance of a crop simulation model (agricultural production systems simulator model, APSIM-Nwheat) was tested using data obtained from several locations in the rain-fed environments of West Asia and North Africa (WANA) in Morocco and Jordan. The model was able to simulate wheat grain yields reasonably well except at one site in one season in Morocco. The model was subsequently used to analyze the effect of soil type (soil water-holding capacity), rate and timing of nitrogen (N) fertiliser, initial soil moisture storage, cultivars (early versus late), sowing dates and density and supplemental irrigation (SI) in optimizing wheat production using 20 years of historical weather records from Morocco. The simulation indicated that yields were often limited by the amount and timing of rainfall. While the effect of N fertiliser was minimal or detrimental in dry years, it improved grain yields in wet years and when crops were sown early combined with pre-sown stored plant available water in the soil. The analysis showed that early sowing is important for achieving high yields by avoiding terminal water deficit. There is little difference between grain yields when current practice of about 300 plants/m(2) was compared with a density of 150 plants/m(2). This implies that there, is scope for reducing current planting density to save seeds without reducing yields. The simulation analysis highlighted that 40 mm of SI at sowing significantly improved average grain yields as a result of enabling early crop establishment, in particular with a N fertiliser application of 40 kg N/ha. The analysis indicated that wheat grain yields in the arid and semi-arid rain-fed regions of WANA can be improved compared to current yield levels by adjusting N management to soil type, pre-sowing soil water availability, sowing opportunity and the availability of SI.

The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) suite of models was parameterised and subsequently used to predict biomass production, yield, crop water and nitrogen (N) use, as well as long-term soil water and organic matter dynamics in wheat/chickpea systems at Tel Hadya, north-western Syria. The model satisfactorily simulated the productivity and water and N use of wheat and chickpea crops grown under different N and/or water supply levels in the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 experimental seasons. Analysis of soil-water dynamics showed that the 2-stage soil evaporation model in APSIM's cascading water-balance module did not sufficiently explain the actual soil drying following crop harvest under conditions where unused water remained in the soil pro. le. This might have been related to evaporation from soil cracks in the montmorillonitic clay soil, a process not explicitly simulated by APSIM. Soil-water dynamics in wheat-fallow and wheat-chickpea rotations (1987-98) were nevertheless well simulated when the soil water content in 0-0.45m soil depth was set to 'air dry' at the end of the growing season each year. The model satisfactorily simulated the amounts of NO3-N in the soil, whereas it underestimated the amounts of NH4-N. Ammonium fixation might be part of the soil mineral-N dynamics at the study site because montmorillonite is the major clay mineral. This process is not simulated by APSIM's nitrogen module. APSIM was capable of predicting long-term trends (1985-98) in soil organic matter in wheat-fallow and wheat-chickpea rotations at Tel Hadya as reported in literature. Overall, results showed that the model is generic and mature enough to be extended to this set of environmental conditions and can therefore be applied to assess the sustainability of wheat-chickpea rotations at Tel Hadya.},

Improved knowledge about crop size at such an early lead time allows marketers to develop and implement a more advanced marketing plan earlier in the season. Producing accurate crop size forecasts at such an early lead time is an on-going challenge for industry. Rather than trying to predict the exact size of the crop, a Bayesian discriminant analysis procedure was applied to determine the likelihood of a small, medium, or large crop across 4 major sugarcane-growing regions in Australia: Ingham, Ayr, Mackay, and Bundaberg. The Bayesian model considers simulated potential yields, climate forecasting indices, and the size of the crop from the previous year. Compared with the current industry approach, the discriminant procedure provided a substantial improvement for Ayr and a moderate improvement over current forecasting methods for the remaining regions, with the added advantage of providing probabilistic forecasts of crop categories.},

	volume = {58},
	doi = {10.1071/AR06097},
	abstract = {Delving is a farming practice involving the mixing of a deep clayey subsoil layer with a sandy topsoil. One of the many effects of this practice is to reduce soil albedo and increase water-holding capacity of the topsoil, thus increasing the potential for storage and release of heat and potential attenuation of the effects of radiative frost. At Keith, a frost-prone location of South Australia, we investigated the effect of management practices with putative capacity to reduce frost damage, with emphasis on delving. Three field experiments were established on Brown Sodosols with a water-repellent sand topsoil. In relation to crops in untreated control soil, delving increased wheat yield from 1.9 to 3.1 t/ha in 2003, and from 0.5 to 1.5 t/ha in 2004. This large delving effect contrasted with the minor effects of other treatments including soil rolling, sowing rate, row spacing, and cultivar mixture. Lack of significant interactions between treatments indicated a robust response to delving across a range of management practices. Topsoil and canopy-height minimum temperatures were consistently higher in the delved treatment. The average difference in canopy-height minimum temperature between delved and control treatments was 0.3-0.4 degrees C, with a maximum of 1.6 degrees C in 2003 and 1.2 degrees C in 2004. A single, robust relationship between yield and frost damage fitted the data pooled across treatments and seasons. This, together with the temperature differential between treatments, and significant relationships between minimum canopy-height temperature around flowering and frost damage supported the conclusion that a substantial part of the yield gain attributable to delving was related to reduced frost damage.},

	doi = {10.1071/AR06176},
	abstract = {The area of canola in the wheat-based farming systems of the wheatbelt of Western Australia (WA) expanded rapidly during the 1990s and has subsequently decreased. Due to the short history of canola production in WA, there is little information on yield and oil content expectations in relation to rainfall, location, and soil type. In this paper we: (1) present the recent history of canola production in the context of the long-term climate record; (2) assess the effect of location, rainfall, soil type, and soil water at sowing on yield and oil content; and (3) determine cut-off sowing dates for profitable canola production. Simulations were run using the APSIM-Canola model with long-term climate records for 3 selected locations from the low-, medium-, and high-rainfall zones and different soil types. Analysis of recent trends in canola area showed that poor seasons and price volatility in the last few years have contributed to farmers' perception of risk and hence the decline in area sown. Long-term simulations showed the importance of location, sowing date, soil type, and stored soil water at sowing on grain yield. Yield was negatively related to sowing date. Light-textured soils had lower yields and larger yield penalties with delayed sowing than heavy-textured soils. Soil water at sowing gave a yield advantage in most years in all locations studied, but especially in low- and medium-rainfall locations. Variation in oil content was most strongly affected by sowing date and location, while soil type and soil water at sowing had a minor effect. Long-term simulation analysis can be used as a tool to establish the latest possible sowing date to achieve profitable canola for different locations and soil types, given different canola prices and growing costs. Given the vulnerability of profitability to seasonal conditions, in the low- and medium-rainfall zone, the decision to grow canola should be tactical depending on stored soil water, sowing opportunities, seasonal climate outlook, prices, and costs. In contrast, in the high-rainfall zone, canola production is relatively low risk, and could become a reliable component of rotations.},

	abstract = {The poor reliability of chickpea yield produced in the marginal ({\textless} 600mm rainfall) areas of the northern cropping zone is a constraint to the wide adoption of the crop. Chickpea is a valuable rotation crop and is currently the only viable winter grain legume suitable to this region. This paper uses results from in-crop monitoring and crop simulation, to identify practical management strategies to improve the reliability of chickpea crops in this region. APSIM- Chickpea successfully simulated the commercial yields of chickpea crops monitored during the study. Soil water at sowing and sowing date were identified as key determinants of yield. A 'rule of thumb' was derived, which showed that crops sown with a starting plant-available water of similar to 100mm at sowing had an 80\% probability of producing a better than break-even yield for the majority of the region and this was independent of the soil's plant- available water capacity or crop sowing date. The probability of accumulating 100mm of stored water in this western region is 90\% following harvest of a May - sown wheat crop. Increased plant population improved crop yields in 60\% of years, but this only translated to improved returns in similar to 50\% of those years. The use of these simple management approaches will improve the reliability of chickpea production and ensure that these marginal areas have the option of a viable winter grain legume in their rotations.},

	abstract = {The long-term effect of lucerne use, in reducing drainage of water below the root zone and runoff (water excess), has not been examined in south-western Australia (Western Australia). The main aims of the paper were to determine how the long-term mean water excess was influenced by the proportion of lucerne in the rotation and the length of the lucerne phase in relation to soil type and location. A simulation model was used to compare scenarios, drawing on historical weather data from 1957 to 2001. Simulations were performed for 2 locations (high and low rainfall) and 2 soil types (high and low water-holding capacity). Lucerne significantly and rapidly (within 2-3 years) reduces the long-term mean water excess in rotations consisting of 2-4 years of lucerne followed by 1-4 years of wheat compared with continuous wheat. For every 10\% increase in the percentage of lucerne years in the total rotation length, the mean water excess decreased by 17-20mm (7-9\%) at Kojonup (high-rainfall site) and 7-8mm (8-9\%) at Buntine (low-rainfall site) compared with the water excess associated with continuous wheat at each location. The proportion of lucerne in the rotation had a greater effect on the water excess than the effect of different soil types. Variation in the water excess due to variation in rainfall was greater than the reduction in water excess due to lucerne. This makes the decisions about when to grow lucerne to reduce water excess difficult if livestock enterprises are less pro. table than cropping enterprises. The simulations show that lucerne mean yearly biomass ranges from 4.5 to 6.9 t/ha at Kojonup and from 1.6 to 4.7 t/ha at Buntine, depending on soil type and stage of lucerne in the land use sequence. It is worth considering that lucerne has the potential to reduce subsequent wheat yields with removal in autumn.},

This paper presents a framework for systematically investigating the effect of the interaction between spatial and temporal variability on economic performance, their relative importance, and the value of spatially variable nitrogen management to a farmer with and without knowledge about the coming season. The paper also addresses the degree to which economic performance is influenced by the relative sizes of management zones for fertiliser inputs, prices, and the shape of the biophysical response to fertiliser in each zone. The analysis was based on a single field exhibiting spatial variability. Scenario analysis of seasonally and/or spatially adjusted nitrogen management strategies was based on response functions generated by the cropping systems model APSIM. The analysis shows that seasonal and spatial interactions in nitrogen management are significant issues for decision makers. In this case, knowledge of the coming season is worth more than knowledge of spatial variability, but knowledge of both creates the greatest value. The functional relationship between yields and fertiliser levels for a given crop also determines the economic value of variable-rate nitrogen. A field may exhibit yield variability but this does not automatically present a case for spatially variable nitrogen management. If economic optima of different payoff curves are aligned then returns to zone management will be limited, despite significant differences in yield between different zones.},

We investigated the value of subsoil water to wheat on the Red Kandosol soils in southern New South Wales, Australia, using the APSIM Wheat model, carefully validated for the study area. Simulation treatments over 106 years of historic climate data involved a factorial combination of (1) a preceding crop of either lucerne (Dry treatment) or a low-yielding wheat crop (Wet treatment) and (2) restriction of wheat root depth to either 1.2 or 1.8 m. Root access to the subsoil (1.2-1.8 m) increased wheat yield by an average of 0.6 and 0.3 t/ha for the Wet and Dry treatments, respectively, at Cootamundra (mean annual rainfall 624 mm) and by 0.5 and 0.1 t/ha at Ardlethan (mean annual rainfall 484 mm). The differences were principally related to the frequency with which the subsoil failed to wet up, which occurred in 8\% and 39\% of years at Cootamundra in Wet and Dry treatments, respectively, but in 21\% and 79\% of years at Ardlethan. In seasons where water from the subsoil was used, the mean value of the water for grain yield, expressed as marginal water-use efficiency (MWUE), was 30-36 kg/ha. mm at both sites. High MWUE ({\textgreater} 60 kg/ha.mm) generally occurred in seasons of above-average rainfall when subsoil water facilitated extra post-anthesis water extraction, including that from upper soil layers, to realise the high yield potential.

	doi = {10.1071/AR07023},
	abstract = {Lucerne phase farming has been suggested as a way of reducing deep drainage in the cereal belt of southern Australia. It is based on the concept that lucerne (Medicago sativa L.), a perennial pasture with a deep root system, creates a soil water storage buffer below the root zone of the annual crops, which gradually refills during the subsequent cropping phase, temporarily reducing the risk of deep drainage. The rate of refilling is variable because it is affected by the amount and distribution of rainfall as well as management of the crop and the summer fallow. There is, therefore, uncertainty about the optimum phase durations that will maximise the effect of the lucerne phase. Computer simulations were applied to evaluate the use of a soil water measurement below the root zone of annual crops to schedule the phase changes, referred to as tactical phase farming. The results confirmed that phase farming reduced average annual deep drainage significantly, but at the cost of lower average annual gross margin. In most cases, tactical phase farming improved the trade-off between deep drainage and gross margin relative to fixed duration phases; for a given amount of average annual deep drainage the average annual gross margin was larger, and for a given gross margin the drainage was smaller. The benefits of tactical phase systems were greatest in soils with a large available water-holding capacity and when the variability of the refilling rate was large. Overall, however, the benefits of the tactical approach relative to fixed phase systems were small.},

A module of the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator Model (APSIM), APSIM-soiltemp, which uses input of ambient temperature, rainfall and solar radiation in conjunction with other APSIM modules, was evaluated for its ability to simulate surface 5 cm soil temperature in 35 peanut on-farm trials conducted between 2001 and 2005 in the Burnett region (25 degrees 36'S to 26 degrees 41'S, 151 degrees 39'E to 151 degrees 53'E). Soil temperature simulated by the APSIM-soiltemp module, from 30 days after sowing until maturity, closely matched the measured values (R-2 {\textgreater}= 0.80) in the first three seasons (2001-04). However, a slightly poorer relationship (R-2 = 0.55) between the observed and the simulated temperatures was observed in 2004-05, when the crop was severely water stressed. Nevertheless, over all the four seasons, which were characterised by a range of ambient temperature, leaf area index, radiation and soil water, each of which was found to have significant effects on soil temperature, a close 1 : 1 relationship (R-2 = 0.85) between measured and simulated soil temperatures was observed. Therefore, the pod zone soil temperature simulated by the module can be generally relied on in place of measured input of soil temperature in APSIM applications, such as quantifying climatic risk of aflatoxin accumulation.},

	abstract = {During the 1990s there was considerable evidence from grower surveys and other regional statistics to suggest that canola ( Brassica napus) yields were declining in the medium and high rainfall areas of southern New South Wales ( NSW). A paddock survey was conducted across three regions of southern NSW over three consecutive seasons ( 2003 - 05) to explore the importance of disease and other possible causes of low productivity. Under- performing paddocks were identified by comparing measured paddock yields with simulated potential yields. The causes of the resultant yield gaps were identified by analysis of the survey results with growers and consultants and from insights provided by the simulation analysis. Seasonal water supply and emergence date accounted for around 70\% of the variation in yield across the survey, although no dependence on these variables was evident in 2005 as a result of high spring rainfall. A majority ( 95) of the 132 paddocks surveyed yielded to within 20\% of the simulated potential yield. Disease, while significant in some paddocks, was limited by the dry seasons, there was no evidence for widespread micronutrient deficiencies and most crops were adequately supplied with nitrogen. There was no single cause of under- performance and the impact of those causes varied across regions and seasons. Subsoil constraints ( seven paddocks) and late season water stress ( six paddocks) were the most common factors associated with under- performance, while five paddocks had inexplicable yield gaps. Restrictions to taproot growth were widespread, especially in the southern region where around 60\% of paddocks had significantly restricted taproots in all seasons ({\textgreater} 3 on a 0 - 5 scale). Survey paddocks in which significant root restriction was found were between 10 and 50\% below potential yield. Subsequent soil profile analysis identified a range of possible subsoil constraints including high soil strength, sodic or saline subsoils or subsurface acidity and further research is warranted to determine their impact on canola productivity in the region.},

Simulated yields of early-, mid- and mid- to- late- maturing varieties of rice grown in a continuous rice cropping system from 1997 to 2004 showed close agreement with the measured data. Similar results were also found for yields simulated under seven levels of nitrogen application. When different transplanting times were modelled, simulated flowering times ranged from within 3 days of the measured values for the early- maturing varieties, to up to 9 days after the measured dates for the mid- and especially mid- to- late- maturing varieties. This was associated with highly variable simulated yields which correlated poorly with the measured data. This suggests the need to accurately calibrate the photoperiod sensitivity parameters of the model for the photoperiod- sensitive rice varieties in Korea.},

Soybean and groundnut are the major oilseed crops and pigeonpea and chickpea are the major pulse crops of the country. In the present study, we have: (a) characterized the distribution of these legumes in different production zones, agro-ecological zones (AEZs) and states of India; (b) estimated the rainfed (water-limited) potential, achievable and current levels of farmers' yields; (c) quantified yield gaps between farmers' yields and rainfed potential yields; and (d) suggested possible ways to abridge the yield gaps. Using CROPGRO and APSIM (for pigeonpea) suite of crop models and historical weather data, rainfed potential yields and water balance of the four legumes were estimated for selected locations representing different production zones in India. The simulated rainfed potential yields were supplemented with the research station yield data of rainfed trials of the All India Coordinated Research Projects (AICRP) for respective crops. Achievable yields of the crops for the locations were taken from the Front Line Demonstrations conducted on-farm with improved technology. District average yields were considered as the farmers' yields. Based on these data, the yield gaps between potential and achievable yields (YG I), between achievable and farmers' yields (YG II) and total yield gaps between potential and farmers' yields were estimated. The farmers' average yield of crops is 1040 kg ha -1 for soybean, 1150 kg ha -1 for groundnut, 690 kg ha -1 for pigeonpea and 800 kg ha -1 for chickpea in India. Large spatial and temporal variability was observed in the yield gaps of the four legumes across the production zones. Total yield gap for the production zones ranged from 850 to 1320 kg ha -1 for soybean, 1180 to 2010 kg ha -1 for groundnut, 550 to 770 kg ha -1 for pigeonpea and 610 to 1150 kg ha -1 for chickpea. YG II formed a significant part of the total yield gap of the four legumes, indicating the need to scale-up the improved crop production technologies from on-farm demonstration sites to farmers in the production zones. Total yield gaps of legumes for the AEZs and states of India were in the similar range as for the production zones. Simulated rainfed potential yields and total yield gaps across different locations for the four legumes showed a positive and significant curvilinear relationship with crop season rainfall. Estimated surface runoff constituted 11 to 54\% of total rainfall received during growing period of the rainy season legumes. To abridge the yield gaps of legumes, integrated watershed management approach comprising of in-situ soil and water conservation, water harvesting and groundwater recharging for supplemental irrigation and improved crop management technologies is needed.},

Simulated farmers formulate individual decisions dealing with land use changes based on the combined performance of their past land cover productivity and market returns. The willingness to adapt to market drivers and the ability to maximize returns varies across farmers. In addition, farmers in the model can demonstrate various attitudes towards salinity mitigation as a consequence of experiencing and perceiving salinity on their farm, in the neighborhood or in the entire region. Consequently, farmers can adopt land cover strategies aiming at reducing salinity impact. The simulation results using historical rainfall records reproduces similar trends of crop-pasture ratios, salinity change and farm decline as observed in the last 20 years in the Katanning catchment (Western Australia). Using the model as an explorative tool for future scenarios, the simulation results highlighted the importance of rainfall changes and wide-spread willingness of farmers to combat dry-land salinity. Rainfall changes as a consequence of climate change can lead to prolonged sequences of dry and wet seasons. Adaptation to these sequences by farmers seems to be critical for farm survival in this catchment.},

	title = {Modelling for scenario analysis for improved smallholder farming systems in {Indonesia}},
	abstract = {A rapid expansion in demand for livestock products is having a major impact on smallholder agricultural production systems throughout the tropical world. This development has had a particularly profound impact on cattle rearing opportunities in eastern Indonesia, where historically high beef prices in the past decade have contributed to a substantial decline in Bali cattle numbers. While the rising demand for beef cattle is providing opportunities for income security through cattle production, taking advantage of this potential has been constrained by limited resources and a difficult production environment. Smallholder farming systems in eastern Indonesia typically involve sowing subsistence food crops in the relatively short rainy season, followed, where possible by cash crops (e. g. peanut, tobacco, maize) in the less reliable early dry season. Small numbers of cattle are kept (2-5), grazing in backyards, roadsides and local forests where access is available. The incorporation of improved forages for feeding cattle into local farming systems could address the prevailing resource constraints. To date, limited use has generally been made of new forage sources as these may be perceived to conflict with household resource demands (esp. working capital and rainy season labour), with traditional cropping systems, and potentially interfere with food security. A whole-farm systems approach which includes both farm and non-farm production and consumption activities, can usefully address these issues. A crop simulation model (APSIM) and an animal production model have been linked with a smallholder household economic model to form an integrated analysis tool (IAT) to support a whole-of-system analysis of alternative forage and livestock options that may be integrated within existing smallholder farming systems. The IAT allows the production, economic and social benefits of such options to be explored concurrently. Preliminary analyses have identified the scope for substantial improvements for animal production, farm profitability and family welfare from within the resources and constraints of current farming practices. Selected crop, forage and livestock management options have been developed through smallholder participation and are now being successfully applied in the field. This paper describes a farming systems research approach to develop an integrated analysis tool (IAT) to explore the opportunities and constraints to increasing the production of Bali cattle on smallholdings. The utility of the IAT is demonstrated with a synthetic case study farm, located in South Sulawesi, exploring 3 prospective forage and husbandry management options, and a change in livestock prices. The case study example results support the apparent opportunity for a farming systems change that favours forages and cattle raising activities to increase smallholder household welfare.},

	abstract = {There are numerous reasons why landholders are looking at revegetating parts of their farms. There is also a range of ways in which these efforts can be configured and managed. The degree to which each design will achieve various social, biodiversity, natural resource or economic goals is not always understood. Woodlots can be different sizes and shapes and the trees can be managed differently in order to meet specific needs. In addition to this, trees can impact on the surrounding farm enterprise and these costs or benefits need to be managed. This study demonstrates a new way to quantify both the biodiversity benefits and economic costs of small agroforestry woodlots. Perhaps the largest cost of woodlots to landholders is the lost production of high value agricultural products. This lost production extends outside the boundary of the woodlot as edge trees compete with neighbouring cropland for water and nutrients. This competition zone has been found to extend up to three times the height of the trees into surrounding farmland and so thin strips of trees can affect areas much larger than their internal area. As a result, landholders need to consider woodlot shape when fitting woodlots within an existing farm. The biodiversity benefit of a woodlot is determined by the size and structural complexity or habitat value of the particular agroforestry enterprise. These benefits can be offset by increased costs associated with displacing larger areas of agricultural production, often with marginal return to the landholder. Similarly, the benefits of altered woodlot structural complexity, via the incorporation of grass or shrub components is not well understood but is likely to result in decreased productivity of the woodlot itself. In this paper we describe a case study that seeks to tease out the tradeoffs involved for agroforestry in dry land farming systems on the Darling Downs in Queensland, Australia. The designs of various agroforestry enterprises are evaluated in terms of the net effect on production and habitat value for woodland birds. Models of different scales and levels of complexity are used to explore tradeoffs between biodiversity benefits and economic costs. Key insights into ways in which trees and crops could be managed include: 1. Manipulation of the structure of low-quality habitat as found in agroforestry systems can result in trading off one habitat structural element for another with very small net effects. For example, competition for water by an added grass layer results in a smaller tree canopy. 2. Economic costs of such a planting are best minimised by structuring the woodlot to shorten the rotation length. This has a minor effect on long term habitat value. 3. Production losses can be minimised by ensuring a minimum woodlot width of 50m or placing the woodlot against roadways or remnant forest. 4. Agronomic changes to surrounding agricultural land may be able to reduce the production footprint of an agroforestry planting. 5. Further analysis is required to compare the relative value of block plantings with very short-rotation low value habitat such as strips of trees.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.pce.2007.07.011},
	abstract = {Zimbabwe's poor are predominantly located in the semi-arid regions and rely on rainfed agriculture for their subsistence. Decline in productivity, scarcity of arable land, irrigation expansion limitations, erratic rainfall and frequent dry spells, among others cause food scarcity. The challenge faced by small-scale farmers is to enhance water productivity of rainfed agriculture by mitigating intra-seasonal dry spells (ISDS) through the adoption of new technologies such as rainwater harvesting (RWH). The paper analyses the agro-hydrological functions of RWH and assesses its impacts (at field scale) on the crop yield gap as well as the Transpirational Water Productivity (WPT). The survey in six districts of the semi-arid Zimbabwe suggests that three parameters (water source, primary use and storage capacity) can help differentiate storage-type-RWH systems from "conventional dams". The Agricultural Production Simulator Model (APSIM) was used to simulate seven different treatments (Control, RWH, Manure, Manure + RWH, Inorganic Nitrogen and Inorganic Nitrogen + RWH) for 30 years on alfisol deep sand, assuming no fertiliser carry over effect from season to season. The combined use of inorganic fertiliser and RWH is the only treatment that closes the yield gap. Supplemental irrigation alone not only reduces the risks of complete crop failure (from 20\% down to 7\% on average) for all the treatments but also enhances WPT (from 1.75 kg m(-3) up to 2.3 kg m(-3) on average) by mitigating ISDS.

	title = {Modelling the performance of different wheat varieties under changed climate-towards better adaptation},
	abstract = {Continued global warming and associated changes in regional rainfall patterns have raised concerns for the sustainability of many agricultural industries in Australia and the World. Examining adaptation options to cope with changed regional climate conditions have often involved simulating the mitigating effects of management interventions e. g. shifting planting windows, planting densities and row configurations. Less emphasis has been placed on examining the impact of changing crop varieties and crop types. In this study, the performance of five wheat varieties (Hartog, Janz, Sunco, Batavia, and Sunbrook) were examined under historical climate and derived climate change scenarios for 2 050 ([CO2] = 570ppm, T + 2.3 degrees C, P - 6.95\%) and 2 070([CO2] = 720ppm, T + 3.8 degrees C, P - 9.75\%) at Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia. The simulation results confirmed that the impacts of the projected climate change on yields were strongly variety-dependent. Amongst the five wheat varieties examined, the mid-maturing varieties Janz and Sunco performed best under historical climate, with average yields of 4.5t/ha. The average yield of other varieties ranged from 4.0 similar to 4.4t/ha. Under the 2050 climate change scenario, 0.9\%, 1.4\%, 8.9\% and 7.6\% yield increases were simulated for the Janz, Sunco, Batavia and Sunbrook varieties, but 2.2\% yield decrease for the early maturing Hartog. Simulated yields under 2070 climate conditions declined for the Hartog,Janz,and Sunco varieties by 11.8\% 5.7\% and 4.6\%, but increased for two late maturing varieties namely Batavia and Sunbrook by 7.1\% and 8.8\% respectively. The results of this study demonstrate that the impacts of climate change can be offset through site-specific varietal changes.},

	volume = {21},
	abstract = {In breeding trials the complexity of interactions of genotypes (G) with their environment (E) requires extensive field experiments at many locations and seasons to test new traits. Management (M) treatments such as planting density and fertilizer supply are often neglected in such experiments. Moreover, several traits (e.g., increased specific leaf area and faster early root growth) are often changed simultaneously in new genotypes (e.g., early vigour lines) with the contribution of individual traits remaining uncertain. Using a well-tested simulation model can assist in exploring the impact of new genotypes and the contribution of individual physiological traits on yield by simulating genotypes across many locations, seasons and a range of management options. Recent advances in simulating grain protein concentrations in wheat also allow the analysis of the impact of yield-related physiological traits on grain protein percentage. Simulation analyses have shown that trait effects on yield are location- and season-specific. The contribution of traits to yield varies with growing-season rainfall and soil types. In Mediterranean-type environments, traits of increased specific leaf area and faster early root growth improve grain yields and water use efficiency on low water-holding-capacity soils, but can be detrimental on better water-holding-capacity soils. Increased specific leaf area is often only expressed if N management is adjusted while the positive effect of faster early root growth in sandy soils diminishes with increasing N supply. The sum of individual traits incorporated in early vigour (that is, increased specific leaf area, faster early root growth, earliness, reduced radiation use efficiency) and increased transpiration efficiency is often not the same as the effects when the traits are combined. Another trait for an increased capacity for storing water-soluble carbohydrates can be beneficial for yield and water use efficiency in terminal-drought environments, but is not as effective when growth is limited by water or nutrients during anthesis. The response of grain protein to yield-related trait modification (such as increased gain-filling rate) is usually negatively related to the response to grain yield. However, under combined water and N limitation, simulations indicated that this negative linear relationship can become non-linear, suggesting that a lower potential yield in such environments might improve grain protein concentrations without reducing the attainable yield.},

	abstract = {Adoption of decision support services (DSS) based on crop growth models has been poor and yet the concept of transferring an increasing body of scientific knowledge via DSSs remains attractive. This study explores the use of the internet and participatory action research (PAR) to develop an irrigation management service called WaterSense for sugarcane irrigators in Australia. WaterSense combines two earlier web-based DSSs, one for use of limited water and the other for scheduling abundant water. In both cases, a small number of dedicated growers and extension staff were involved in designing and conducting field experiments to test concepts that were later included in the DSSs. An optimization procedure ( Caneoptimiser), based on the APSIM-Sugarcane model was developed for applying limited irrigation when most needed. However, the optimization took too long to operate as a web service. Growers with abundant water prompted the development of a simple water balance technique (called ' WaterBalance') for scheduling irrigation over the Internet. Growers with limited irrigation wanted the service offered by Caneoptimser with the speed and format of WaterBalance. A new service called WaterSense was developed using algorithms for canopy development and soil water hydrology from Caneoptimser and algorithms for reference evapotranspiration and crop factors from WaterBalance. Adoption by those familiar with the background research has been immediate. Indications are that the combined use of the Internet, PAR and concurrent research and demonstration will open the way for the adoption of research findings in the management of irrigation and possibly other aspects of sugarcane farming. However, widespread adoption of DSSs cannot depend on participation of the intensity required for their development. Processes of adoption beyond the case study need further research.},

	abstract = {We up-scaled the APSIM simulation model of crop growth, water and nitrogen dynamics to interpret and respond to spatial and temporal variations in soil, season and crop performance and improve yield and decrease nitrate leaching. Grain yields, drainage below the maximum root depth and nitrate leaching are strongly governed by interaction of plant available soil water storage capacity (PAWC), seasonal rainfall and nitrogen supply in the water-limited Mediterranean-type environment of Western Australia (WA). APSIM simulates the interaction of these key system parameters and the robustness of its simulations has been rigorously tested with the results of several field experiments covering a range of soil types and seasonal conditions in WA. We used yield maps, soil and weather data for farms at two locations in WA to determine spatial and temporal patterns of grain yield, drainage below the maximum root depth and nitrate leaching under a range of weather, soil and nitrogen management scenarios. On one farm, we up-scaled APSIM simulations across the whole farm using local weather and fertiliser use data and the average PAWC values of soil type polygons. On a 70 ha field on another farm, we used a linear regression of apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) measured by EM38 against PAWC to transform an ECa map of the field into a high resolution (5 m grid) PAWC map. We then used regressions of simulated yields, drainage below the maximum root depth and nitrate leaching on PAWC to upscale the APSIM simulations for a range of weather and fertiliser management scenarios. This continuous mapping approach overcame the weakness of the soil polygons approach, which assumed uniformity in soil properties and processes within soil type polygons. It identified areas at greatest financial and environmental risks across the field, which required focused management and simulated their response to management interventions. Splitting nitrogen applications increased simulated wheat yields at all sites across the field and decreased nitrate leaching particularly where the water storage capacity of the soil was small. Low water storage capacity resulted in both low wheat yields and large leaching loss. Another management option to decrease leaching may be to grow perennial vegetation that uses more water and loses less by drainage.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.eja.2006.04.005},
	abstract = {The performance of the APSIM-Nwheat model for the simulation of grain protein levels has previously been tested across a number of environments, but the influence of management, environment and genotype on protein levels has not been fully investigated. A number of simulation exercises were carried out to analyse the sensitivity of the APSIM-Nwheat grain protein routine to environmental and genetic factors. The model initialises grain protein at 17\% at the beginning of the linear phase of grain filling if sufficient N is available in the crop. Grain protein concentration is then simulated as a consequence of daily grain N and grain weight accumulation as two independent temperature functions that are constrained at their extremes. An upper boundary of daily protein accumulation in the grain is set at 23\%. The lower boundary of grain protein daily accumulation is set to 7\%. The simulated responses were consistent with published trends. An increased temperature during grain filling accelerated grain N accumulation more than grain weight accumulation and resulted in a higher grain protein concentration at crop maturity. Increased water shortage due to reduced rainfall had a negative effect on grain numbers per unit area, grain size and grain N accumulation, resulting in an increased grain protein concentration. Water shortage which started after grain numbers had been set at the beginning of grain filling had a small positive impact, or sometimes no impact, on grain protein concentration. Simulating crop growth with more than 100 years of historical weather records showed that initial grain protein concentration, grain protein dynamics and final grain protein concentration varied substantially between seasons. In addition, N supply affected grain protein, but the magnitude of the effect depended on the specific season. Location also affected grain protein via seasonal rainfall and temperature, so that grain protein declined linearly with a seasonal rainfall/temperature index. When the potential rate for grain dry matter accumulation was increased in the model to reflect an increase in the genetic yield potential, grain protein concentration declined linearly with increasing yield under optimal water and N supply. Increasing temperatures and water shortage or sub-optimal N supply shifted the line but the linear relationship was maintained. All these model responses to environmental and genetic effects were similar to expectations based on field or greenhouse studies. The close linear negative relationship between grain protein concentration and grain yield highlights the genetic limitation to increases in grain protein, which agrees well with experimental findings elsewhere. However, under combined water and N limitations, the model suggested that this negative linear relationship can become non-linear in some situations, which needs to be verified under controlled environment and field conditions.

	volume = {24},
	doi = {10.1016/j.eja.2005.11.001},
	abstract = {In the temperate climate of northeast Germany, a trade-off exists between water use in agricultural crop production and groundwater recharge which is important for urban water supply, irrigation, forestry and peat protection. The APSIM-Nwheat model was used to analyze the impact of climate change scenarios on deep drainage (DD), the water loss below the maximum root zone as the main source of groundwater recharge, and wheat production for two main soil types. A linear and a nonlinear climate scenario were used in this study: The linear scenario for 2001-2050 was based on a simple linearly modified historical climate record from 1951 to 2000. The nonlinear scenario used the same 1951-2000 historical climate record but combined it nonlinearly with a Global Circulation Model climate scenario for 2001-2050. Simulation results showed different distributions of deep drainage and grain yield with the linear and nonlinear scenarios, but no difference in the 50-year averages. Hence, a linear manipulation of climate records can be as effective for climate change impact studies on deep drainage and grain yield as nonlinearly manipulated climate data, if long-term average changes are of main interest. The simulation results indicated that a trade-off between deep drainage and grain yields can be potentially controlled through N management. However, such control mechanism was more effective under current climate conditions than under future climate and on a better water-holding silt soil compared to a poorer water-holding loamy sand. It is suggested that areas with poor water-holding soils should be managed extensively for groundwater recharge harvesting while better water-holding soils should be used for high input grain production.

	doi = {10.1007/s11104-006-0012-5},
	abstract = {Wheat yields in the Mediterranean climate of Western and Southern Australia are often limited by water. Our measurements on a 70 ha growers field showed linear relationships between grain yield and the plant available soil water storage capacity (PAWc) of the top 100 cm of the soil profile. PAWc was linearly related to apparent soil electrical conductivity measured by proximal sensing using electromagnetic induction (EM38). The APSIM wheat model also employs PAWc as one of the systems parameters and simulated linear relationships between PAWc and yield. These relationships were used to transform an EM38-derived PAWc map of the field into yield maps for three major season types (dry, medium and wet) and nitrogen (N) fertiliser management scenarios. The results indicated that the main cause of temporal and spatial yield variability within the field was due to interactions of seasonal rainfall, PAWc and N fertiliser applications. Spatial variability was low in low rainfall years when yields across the field were low and the higher soil water storage capacity sites were often underutilised. With adequate N, spatial variability increased with seasonal rainfall as sites with higher PAWc conserved more water in wet seasons to give higher yield response than sites with low PAWc. The higher yield response of high PAWc sites to rainfall gave rise to larger temporal variability compared with sites with low PAWc. Provision of adequate N is required for the water limited yield potential to be expressed and this increased both spatial and temporal variability. Sites with low PAWc performed poorly irrespective of rainfall and N application. PAWc is inherently low on deep coarse sands; these sites should be considered for a change in land use. Elsewhere, strategic management interventions should aim to improve PAWc through sub-soil amelioration and deep root growth to increase the capital asset of the farm. The resulting increase in yields will occur in favourable seasons and with adequate fertiliser provisions. The largest grain yield response to water and N will be obtained on sites with the highest PAWc and it is at those sites that the greatest profits from fertiliser use could be achieved in wet seasons.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of weeds in northern grain cropping systems are complex, due to the relatively variable potential growing conditions in any given year. Weeds may germinate and grow during a fallow season or may be forced to compete with a crop. Rainfall is unpredictable. Due to this high variability in cropping and rainfall conditions, soil moisture, nutrition, and covering organic matter all vary widely from one year to the next; similarly, interspecific competition and seed bank dynamics are equally likely to vary. Accordingly, any attempt to model the population dynamics of northern region weeds appears to require a relatively complex approach. We have coupled a well-verified crop growth model (APSIM) with seed bank and mating sub-models (implemented in Vensim) in an attempt to deal with this level of environmental variability, and to test the effects of various aspects of the cropping system on the rate at which resistance to glyphosate might evolve in local weed populations. APSIM deals with the dynamics of the weeds and crops during the growth phase. The Vensim extensions deal with the effects of mating parameters (that is, the effect of the level of self-compatibility in the weed species) and seed bank dynamics, such as the level of mortality in the seed bank, and the germination rate in a particular season.},

	doi = {10.1071/AR04103},
	abstract = {This paper investigates factors controlling soil water content changes during the non-growing summer autumn season or fallow (December-May) in annual farming systems in southern Western Australia. This was achieved by examining variation in available soil water storage to a depth of 1.0-1.5m at 3 sites within 13 seasons. Reasons for the variation were examined using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM). This paper also investigated whether water accumulation during the summer-autumn period (fallow) contributed to drainage during the following growing season (May-November). This was achieved by determining the relationship between soil water content at the end of the fallow period (1 May) and the amount of drainage below 2.5 m by using APSIM coupled to historical weather records at 3 locations. At the end of the fallow, 24 mm (or 25\%) of rain falling during the fallow was retained in the soil. Evaporation was the main loss of soil water during fallow periods (mean of 60 mm). Other losses included transpiration from plant cover (mean of 12 mm) and drainage below the root zone and runoff (combined mean of 13 mm). Evaporation and transpiration losses of soil water were concentrated in the surface 0.3 m. The use of APSIM to determine changes in the soil water content during the fallow indicated the importance of plants to soil water losses, the potential for higher evaporation than previously reported, and the possibility of an extended period (4-6 weeks) of drainage in sandy soils after large rainfall events ({\textgreater}50 mm). Soil water accumulation during the fallow period had a significant effect on simulated drainage under wheat in the following growing season. By the end of fallow there was limited ability of the soil to store water before drainage occurred due to rainfall during the fallow and the small soil water deficit under annual farming systems (1-67 mm). A 1-mm increase in soil wetness at the end of the fallow resulted in a 0.7-1-mm increase in simulated drainage during the growing season.},

	abstract = {The APSIM-Wheat module was used to investigate our present capacity to simulate wheat yields in a semi-arid region of eastern Australia (the Victorian Mallee), where hostile subsoils associated with salinity, sodicity, and boron toxicity are known to limit grain yield. In this study we tested whether the effects of subsoil constraints on wheat growth and production could be modelled with APSIM-Wheat by assuming that either: (a) root exploration within a particular soil layer was reduced by the presence of toxic concentrations of salts, or (b) soil water uptake from a particular soil layer was reduced by high concentration of salts through osmotic effects. After evaluating the improved predictive capacity of the model we applied it to study the interactions between subsoil constraints and seasonal conditions, and to estimate the economic effect that subsoil constraints have on wheat farming in the Victorian Mallee under different climatic scenarios. Although the soils had high levels of salinity, sodicity, and boron, the observed variability in root abundance at different soil layers was mainly related to soil salinity. We concluded that: (i) whether the effect of subsoil limitations on growth and yield of wheat in the Victorian Mallee is driven by toxic, osmotic, or both effects acting simultaneously still requires further research, (ii) at present, the performance of APSIM-Wheat in the region can be improved either by assuming increased values of lower limit for soil water extraction, or by modifying the pattern of root exploration in the soil pro. le, both as a function of soil salinity. The effect of subsoil constraints on wheat yield and gross margin can be expected to be higher during drier than wetter seasons. In this region the interaction between climate and soil properties makes rainfall information alone, of little use for risk management and farm planning when not integrated with cropping systems models.},

Two years of the tropical legumes Macrotyloma daltonii and Vigna trilobata (both self regenerating annual legumes) and Lablab purpureus (a resown annual legume) resulted in soil nitrate N (0-0.9 m depth), at sorghum sowing, ranging from 35 to 86 kg/ha compared with 4 kg/ha after pure grass pastures. Average grain sorghum production in the 4 cropping seasons following the grazed legume leys ranged from 2651 to 4012 kg/ha. Following the grass pasture, grain sorghum production in the first and second year was {\textless} 1900 kg/ha and by the third year grain yield was comparable to the legume systems. Simulation studies utilising the farming systems model APSIM indicated that the soil N and water dynamics following 2-year ley phases could be closely represented over 4 years and the prediction of sorghum growth during this time was reasonable. In simulated unfertilised sorghum crops grown from 1954 to 2004, grain yield did not exceed 1500 kg/ha in 50\% of seasons following a grass pasture, while following 2-year legume leys, grain exceeded 3000 kg/ha in 80\% of seasons.

The aims of this study were to examine root system characteristics of two wheat genotypes contrasting in tolerance to water limitation and to assess the functional implications on adaptation to water-limited environments of any differences found. The drought tolerant barley variety, Mackay, was also included to allow inter-species comparison. Single plants were grown in large, soil-filled root-observation chambers. Root growth was monitored by digital imaging and water extraction was measured. Root architecture differed markedly among the genotypes. The drought-tolerant wheat (cv. SeriM82) had a compact root system, while roots of barley cv. Mackay occupied the largest soil volume. Relative to the standard wheat variety (Hartog), SeriM82 had a more uniform rooting pattern and greater root length at depth. Despite the more compact root architecture of SeriM82, total water extracted did not differ between wheat genotypes. To quantify the value of these adaptive traits, a simulation analysis was conducted with the cropping system model APSIM, for a wide range of environments in southern Queensland, Australia. The analysis indicated a mean relative yield benefit of 14.5\% in water-deficit seasons. Each additional millimetre of water extracted during grain filling generated an extra 55 kg ha(-1) of grain yield. The functional implications of root traits on temporal patterns and total amount of water capture, and their importance in crop adaptation to specific water-limited environments, are discussed.},

This paper provides a brief review of the irrigation research conducted in the Ord since 1996. A companion paper will review the research-extension-grower interaction that guided the research and led to the development and adoption of a web-based scheduling system. Five replicated scheduling experiments were conducted to test yield response to various irrigation schedules based on Class A pan evaporation, neutron moisture measurements and the APSIM-Sugarcane model. The research led to the development of average monthly irrigation intervals for different soil types and cropping cycles. It was soon evident that the average irrigation cycles were often wrong when weather conditions were not 'average'. The research and development direction turned to real-time methods for monitoring crop water use and irrigation scheduling. Daily crop evapotranspiration (ET c) was measured using a Bowen ratio energy balance system. A crop factor regime was established using reference ET. A web-based system was developed to accept grower details on soil type, planting and ratooning dates, and to report calculated soil water deficit and days to the next irrigation for each paddock Ord growers now access the web program to schedule irrigation.},

	abstract = {Infection with the parasitic weed crenate broomrape (Orobanche crenata Forsk.) causes considerable yield losses in legumes grown in Mediterranean climates. Strategies to control the parasite must include the long-term containment of its soil seedbank. This requires a better understanding of seedbank and competition dynamics. Hence, we built a model of crenate broomrape seedbank dynamics and combined it with a model of broad bean (Vicia faba L.)-crenate broomrape competition within the simulation framework of the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM). Parasite seed production is modeled as a function of parasite dry weight, which is an output of the competition model. Newly produced seeds are progressively added to the topmost of three vertically organized seed classes and vertically redistributed by tillage. Seed viability loss follows negative exponential functions, with the rate of seed decay depending on soil moisture status. Effects of further external factors, such as temperature, are not yet included. Viable parasite seeds present at sowing of a host crop serve as input to the next run of the competition model. We quantified effects of environment, rotation, tillage, hand-pulling, and combined strategies on parasite seedbank dynamics and broad bean yield through multiseason simulations. Modeled responses compared well with previously reported field observations. Results suggest that only by combining several management approaches, such as delayed sowing, no-till, and hand-pulling, can parasite populations be contained.},

	abstract = {Cereal-legume intercropping plays an important role in subsistence food production in developing countries, especially in situations of limited water resources. Crop simulation can be used to assess risk for intercrop productivity over time and space. In this study, a simple model for intercropping was developed for cereal and legume growth and yield, under semi-arid conditions. The model is based on radiation interception and use, and incorporates a water stress factor. Total dry matter and yield are functions of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), the fraction of radiation intercepted and radiation use efficiency (RUE). One of two PAR sub-models was used to estimate PAR from solar radiation; either PAR is 50\% of solar radiation or the ratio of PAR to solar radiation (PAR/SR) is a function of the clearness index (K-T). The fraction of radiation intercepted was calculated either based on Beer's Law with crop extinction coefficients (K) from field experiments or from previous reports. RUE was calculated as a function of available soil water to a depth of 900 mm (ASW). Either the soil water balance method or the decay curve approach was used to determine ASW. Thus, two alternatives for each of three factors, i.e., PAR/SR, K and ASW, were considered, giving eight possible models (2 methods x 3 factors). The model calibration and validation were carried out with maize-bean intercropping systems using data collected in a semi-arid region (Bloemfontein, Free State, South Africa) during seven growing seasons (1996/1997-2002/2003). The combination of PAR estimated from the clearness index, a crop extinction coefficient from the field experiment and the decay curve model gave the most reasonable and acceptable result. The intercrop model developed in this study is simple, so this modelling approach can be employed to develop other cereal-legume intercrop models for semi-arid regions. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

These models are able to capture the pattern of N release that is attributable to the N concentration of plant materials, or more generally the C:N ratio of the organic input. However, the models are unable to simulate the more complex pattern of N release that has been observed for some animal manures, notably materials that exhibit initial immobilization of N even when the C:N of the material suggests it should mineralize N. The APSIM SoilN module was modified so that the three pools that constitute added organic matter could be specified in terms of both the fraction of carbon in each pool and also their C:N ratios (previously it has been assumed that all pools have the same C:N ratio). It is shown that the revised model is better able to simulate the general patterns on N mineralized that has been reported for various organic sources. By associating the model parameters with measured properties (the pool that decomposes most rapidly equates with water-soluble C and N; the pool that decomposes slowest equates with lignin-C) the model performed better than the unmodified model in simulating the N mineralization from a range of feeds and faecal materials measured in an incubation experiment.

The potential effects of growing grain sorghum on components of the water balance, sorghum biomass and grain production, and yield of subsequent wheat crops were investigated by simulation using APSIM and long-term climate data from the Esperance district. Sorghum was simulated as part of 3 systems: ( 1) as an opportunity crop following wheat harvest, ( 2) as a fallow replacement after pasture removal and before entering a cropping phase, or ( 3) as a fallow replacement after a failed or waterlogged winter crop. Simulations were conducted for the period 1957 - 2003 at Myrup ( mean annual rainfall 576 mm), Scaddan ( 408 mm), and Salmon Gums ( 346 mm). Sorghum was assumed to have a similar rooting depth to wheat. In order to gain confidence in using APSIM for these investigations, tests were initially conducted against field data involving summer and winter crops in sequence and measurements of soil water dynamics. Data sets also varied in summer rainfall, species ( forage sorghum, grain sorghum, Japanese millet), and soil type ( deep sand, and medium and shallow duplex). Overall, the simulations showed that incorporation of a sorghum crop increased transpiration by 10 - 30 mm/year, made the soil pro. le drier by a similar amount at wheat sowing, and consequently reduced deep drainage by 3 - 25 mm/year, depending upon cropping system and location. Long-term average drainage results were dominated by large episodes in wet years. The increased transpiration from the summer crop, although reducing drainage in wet years, could not eliminate drainage. Following wheat yields were reduced by an average of 200 - 400 kg/ha, corresponding to a reduction of 10\% at wetter and 30\% at drier locations.

	abstract = {With increasing salinity in irrigation areas, the option of tree planting in areas with shallow groundwater is seen as an 'environmentally friendly' alternative for controlling salinity. This study uses simulation modelling to investigate the long-term effects of planting Eucalyptus grandis in irrigated areas with shallow and saline watertables in the Riverine Plains where concerns exist about salinity effects on irrigated agriculture. APSIM, a 1-dimensional model of the soil-water-plant system, was modified to describe the interaction between the watertable within the plantation with the, normally shallower, watertable in the surrounding irrigated pasture. The model was tested against measured data and then used to simulate a range of different environmental conditions (depth and salinity of the groundwater, soil) and management options (irrigation with different amounts and salinity). The results of a total of 702 simulation runs helped to identify conditions in which irrigated plantations may be viable and how the irrigation of these plantations may be managed to decrease the impact of salinity on tree growth. The results indicated that if irrigation is to improve productivity, it must be in large amounts (1000 mm or more) and of good quality to have a significant effect on tree production. Irrigation with low salinity water (EC {\textless} 2 dS/m) can only be used to reliably increase production in conditions where there are deeper watertables (4 m or deeper) on fast-draining soils. In these cases, flexible irrigation practices (scheduled irrigation) need to be employed in order to manage the salt levels within the tree root-zones. The viability of plantations is likely to decrease with increasing irrigation water salinity as salt accumulation in the pro. le reduces the ability of the trees to act as natural sinks. Depending on the irrigation and groundwater salinity, trees might be effective only up to a few years (as little as 9 years). Optimum response of trees to irrigation is only predicted with fresh water and scheduled irrigation (up to 1700 mm/year). However, if ample fresh water was available, other higher value cropping options are likely to be sought by land managers. Furthermore, the large amounts of water added to the plantation will have negative effects (water and salt export from the plantation) on the surrounding land, which will need further intervention to be sustainable.},

	abstract = {The environment in which crops will be grown in the future will change. Temperatures and CO(2) concentrations [CO(2)] will increase. Also a decline in winter rainfall of up to 30\% in 2070 is predicted for south-west Australia. Effects of climate change on cropping systems were simulated with the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM-Nwheat) using transformed historic weather data. Fifty years of yield were simulated for three soil types at different locations on a north - south transect within the wheatbelt of south-west Australia. Simulation results showed that there were complex interactions between different aspects of climate change on crop systems. Effects of higher temperatures, elevated [CO(2)] and changed rainfall were in general not linear and differed significantly between soil types and location. Higher [CO(2)] increased yield especially at drier sites while higher temperatures especially had a positive effect in the cooler and wetter southern part of the region. The main difference between soil types was that heavier clay soils were most vulnerable to reduced rainfall while sandy soils were more vulnerable to higher temperatures. We tested which changes in crop traits would be a good adaptation to climate change for wheat systems. Earlier flowering varieties can increase production at lower rainfall and ambient temperatures. At increased temperatures a later maturing variety will promote wheat production. On clay soils early vigor did not improve yields for historic and future climate scenarios. Also increased rooting depth did not positively affect yields on clay soils. So the options for adapting cropping systems to climate change on clay seem to be limited. This in combination with the results that yields on clay soils are reduced the most by climate change makes these soils very vulnerable to the impacts of a drying climate. On loamy sand soils however there are plenty of opportunities to adapt cropping systems to climate change. In addition to longer season varieties and early vigor also increased rooting depth can significantly increase yields under future climate change.},

	title = {Predicting the impact of climatic variability on deep drainage under dryland agriculture},
	abstract = {Dryland salinity in southern Australia is caused by increased deep water losses (deep drainage) under annual crops and pastures that replaced the original perennial vegetation. Phase farming, in which lucerne, a perennial pasture with a deep root system, is grown in rotation with annual crops is a promising option to reduce deep drainage. The lucerne phase extracts soil water from below the rooting depth of annual crops, preventing its loss to the groundwater, and creating a buffer which refills again under annual cropping. The optimal length of the phases is variable and depends strongly on rainfall. Basing phase change decisions on a measurement of soil water below the root zone of annual crops (tactical management) is expected to optimise phase lengths, reducing drainage and maximising the time under (more profitable) cropping. Computer simulations are the only practical way to evaluate the benefits and risks of such a system as year-to-year variability of deep drainage under these systems is high. It is important, however, that the effect of climatic variability is fully explored. Simulations of agricultural systems usually use an historical climate record, implicitly assuming that this captures climatic variability adequately. For stream flow and flood prediction purposes, the historical climate data record is usually not considered long enough to describe the variability that may be experienced. Stochastic data generation is therefore employed to capture more of the variability contained in the historical climate record. We explored the effects of climatic variability on deep drainage under dryland agriculture using two different methods to capture this variability: the 48-year historical climate record and multiple records generated by a daily stochastic climate model. Using a stochastic climate model demonstrates the potential variability in average annual rainfall. While the overall average (557 mm) matched that of the 48-year historical record (553 mm), the 48-year averages for individual generated records ranged from 495 to 627 mm. Deep drainage under dryland agriculture is a complex and non-linear process. The simulations showed that the ordering of years in a climate record affected the predicted drainage due to carry-over effects from year to year. Predicted average annual drainage under annual cropping varied by 20\% when specific patterns of wetter and drier years were created by manually reordering the years in the historical climate record. With stochastically generated climate input, the predicted average annual drainage varied even more, due to a strong relationship between average annual drainage and average annual rainfall, which is not constrained to the historical average, as it is for the manually reordered records. Introduction of a more complete description of the potential climate variability by using stochastically generated records when simulating the outcomes of using a fixed rotation and tactical management of lucerne resulted in a different evaluation of the options. The outcomes predicted using the historical record rarely coincided with the average of outcomes predicted using the stochastic climate records. It also resulted in an understanding of the probability of different outcomes, not possible from using the historical record alone. We conclude that when outputs are a consequence of the combination of crop type and climate over a number of years a better representation of the variability of the climate-soil-vegetation system is required than can be obtained using the historical climate record alone. The use of stochastically generated climate input into multiple simulations allows a better understanding of the potential outcomes and their probability of occurrence, while preserving the inherent nature of the historical record.},

	abstract = {Integrated natural resource models (e. g., APSIM) are typically large and complex, thus, it can be difficult to prioritize parameters that are most promising with respect to system management goals. It is important to evaluate how a model responds to changes in its inputs as part of the process of model development, verification, and evaluation. There are several techniques for sensitivity analysis used by practitioners and analysts in numerous fields. For example, sensitivity analysis methods are commonly built-in features of a particular software tool, e. g., Crystal Ball or @Risk. However, there are other sensitivity analysis methods, including those used outside of the natural resources field, applicable to integrated system models. In this paper, we concentrate on qualitatively evaluating four sensitivity analysis methods: 1) Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (FAST), 2) Response Surface Method (RSM), 3) Mutual Information Index (MII), and 4) the methods of Sobol'. For sensitivity analysis of natural resource models, the FAST and Sobol' methods are particularly attractive. These methods are capable of computing the so-called "Total Sensitivity Indices" (TSI), which measure parameter main effects and all of the interactions (of any order) involving that parameter. Additional recommendations resulting from our evaluation include: Sensitivity analysis should be used prior to model development, during model development, and when the model is applied to a specific problem. Sensitivity analysis provides useful risk insights, but alternative approaches are also needed to understand "which" parameters show up as important and "why" they show up as important. Sensitivity analysis can be a valuable tool in building confidence in the model and in the embedded computer codes. In spite of current advances, the state-of-the-science has not matured to the point of quantitatively deriving significance from sensitivity analyses as input to final decision-making. The use of global sensitivity methods is emphasized herein. Many methods currently in use have some sort of global aspect (though not explicitly recognized), in particular, variance-based sensitivity measures (e. g., FAST and Sobol') are concise and easy to understand and communicate. There is a concern that uncertainty and sensitivity analysis methods could be incorrectly used to make a case for or against a project. Therefore, there is a need to develop guidance documents (with expert involvement or endorsement) that will provide sensitivity analysis practitioners with knowledge of what is available, and the context of where the methods can be used (i.e., when to use them, and how to use them). Recent developments illustrate the tremendous need for implementing quantitative sensitivity analyses. Furthermore, a gap remains in public education of the utility and implementation of sensitivity analysis methods in the decision-making process. Issues addressed in this paper pertaining to the application of sensitivity analysis in natural resource modeling include: 1) criteria for sensitivity analysis methods applied to natural resource models, 2) identification of several promising sensitivity analysis methods for application to natural resource models, and 3) needs for implementation and demonstration of sensitivity analysis methods. As stated above, it is our goal that this paper will eventually lead to creation of a guidance document for assisting practitioners with regard to the selection of sensitivity analysis methods, and their application, interpretation, and reporting. The overall guidelines should not be too restrictive, but instead provide useful boundaries and principles for selecting, using, and interpreting results from sensitivity analysis methods.},

	abstract = {Groundwater levels rose (an average of 10m) (mostly in 1970's and 80's) due to irrigation induced recharge to the groundwater in Coleambally Irrigation Area (CIA). Water table depth rise was a direct result of the net amount of recharge over and above the regional groundwater outflow capacity. Control of net recharge through a range of options is critical to the sustainability of CIA and requires both on-farm and regional management options for the groundwater discharge zones. There are two components to the management of recharge: The on-farm component, and the regional component. A regional groundwater model is used to look at overall targets of net recharge within the CIA. This model sets net recharge targets and is used to identify key processes and examine the effect of regional groundwater pumping on watertables and evaluate scenarios. The on-farm component captures the variability of soils, crops, and management at different parts of the region. This study is aimed at investigating regional groundwater outflow characteristics in CIA on clustered farms basis to help identify Land and Water Management Plan (LWMP) targets for water use efficiency and drainage improvement at farm level linked to the regional targets. The groundwater balance for clusters of farms and the groundwater zones was obtained by calibrating a regional groundwater model (MODFLOW) for the Coleambally area. Calibration of the groundwater model helped to quantify vertical and lateral groundwater outflow capacity on a regional and sub-regional basis. Estimates of vertical recharge were obtained by using one-dimensional water balance model called APSIM. APSIM model was applied to 18 detailed monitoring piezometer sites with known water level records scattered in 5 zones of the CIA (Figure 1) to calculate the drainage values (mm/day) for each zone. APSIM results indicate risk of salinisation in most zones. APSIM results depict only the 1-D groundwater dynamics under non-irrigated areas whereas mixed landuse were represented in the MODFLOW cells. A possible way forward is to carry out APSIM simulations for all landuses in each land management unit. However it would require detailed data for each landuse and soil type which was beyond the scope of this study. Although APSIM fluxes do not directly match the MODFLOW calibrated values, they were useful in providing a cross check on the relative magnitude. The analysis has shown that on a regional basis the vertical leakage capacity of the shallow aquifers (20,000-30,000 ML/year) needs to be matched with the overall recharge to maintain current groundwater levels. Since groundwater levels in some regions e. g. south and west (zones 3 and 4 in Figure 1) are already within the root zone there is a need to initially reduce groundwater recharge to less than the aquifer outflow capacity. These regions have the highest risk of soil salinisation. There is a need to reduce total on farm recharge to less than 0.5 ML/ha using winter cropping options as well as limited rice water use and improved water use efficiency. Drainage and reuse options should be considered for some parts of these zones. [GRAPHICS]},

	abstract = {Supplementary irrigation is important for sugarcane productivity and viability of cane farming in many regions where rainfall is the main source of water supply to the crop. Growers have to contend with variable and unpredictable rainfall and with variable water allocations. Because of uncertainty about the season's water allocations, growers are reluctant to use all their assured allocation early for fear of dry periods later in the growth of the crop. In many seasons, allocations are not fully utilized. Growers require some way of assessing the risk of using their water early. An optimizing technique (Watersense) for determining the best time to irrigate sugarcane with limited irrigation was developed using the APSIM-Sugarcane model. Watersense aims to find an irrigation strategy that minimizes overall water stress and provides the highest yield. A replicated experiment was established on the farm of David Lawson near Bundaberg, Queensland, Australia, to compare irrigation schedules based on Watersense (Plus treatment) and the grower's considerable experience (Grower treatment). The treatments were compared by noting irrigation times and yield components, determined by sampling, over three ratoons (2nd, 3rd and 4th). Crop water use was measured with an EnviroSCAN system in the last two ratoons. The Grower and Plus irrigation schedules were remarkably similar for the second and third ratoon crops. In the fourth ratoon, the grower used all the water available by April while Watersense saved some water for May. In the third ratoon, biomass was greater in the Grower than the Plus treatment even though the Plus treatment used more water. In the fourth ratoon, sucrose content was higher in the Plus treatment and resulted in a slightly greater sucrose yield in this treatment. The probability of predicting the correct irrigation date was much greater for irrigations in the near rather than in the distant future. While information about irrigations far into the future may be vague, the information can indicate by when the allocations should be used. Watersense should help growers to use their allocations at the best time and should encourage use of all water allocated every year.},

	abstract = {A comparison of the environmental impacts of organic and conventional sugarcane growing in Queensland (Australia) has been undertaken using environmental life cycle assessment. The aim of the assessment was to provide initial insight into the comparative environmental performance of organic and conventional cane growing as currently practised in Queensland. The assessment used primary data from cane farms in the Rocky Point and Mackay canegrowing areas that participated in a recent RIRDC-funded project to investigate the fledgling organic cane industry, data from cane production models, as well as simulated agronomic data from the APSIM crop modelling tool. This paper reports results for energy input, greenhouse gas emissions, acidification potential and eutrophication potential. The results show that, for the impact categories of energy input and greenhouse gas emissions, there is no significant difference between the two systems. The energy avoided by not using synthetic fertilisers and chemicals is offset by the more intensive use of machinery and the transport of low-density nutrient sources in organic systems. However, growing organic cane may provide greenhouse gas benefits if the expected lower levels of denitrification are taken into consideration. Organic growing can provide benefits in relation to water quality and eco-toxicity due to the elimination of inorganic fertilisers, herbicides, and pesticides. The lower yields currently being achieved from organic cane, due to conversion of the system, have a significant influence on the overall environmental burden per tonne of cane. However, if yields were to increase to levels comparable with conventional cane due to improvements in soil health and nutrient levels, this would improve the environmental performance of organic systems relative to conventional systems.},

Analyses suggest that at least half of the increase in rainfall-use efficiency can be attributed to improved agronomic management. Various methods of analysing the factors influencing dryland yields and rainfall-use efficiency, such as simple rules and more complex models, are presented and the agronomic factors influencing water use, water-use efficiency, and harvest index of crops are discussed. The adoption of agronomic procedures such as minimum tillage, appropriate fertilizer use, improved weed/disease/insect control, timely planting, and a range of rotation options, in conjunction with new cultivars, has the potential to increase the yields and rainfall-use efficiency of dryland crops. It is concluded that most of the agronomic options for improving rainfall-use efficiency in rainfed agricultural systems decrease water losses by soil evaporation, runoff, throughflow, deep drainage, and competing weeds, thereby making more water available for increased water use by the crop.},

	abstract = {Over the last 10 years, there has been a rapid expansion of rainfed cotton production in Australia. The majority of this area has used "skip row" configurations in which certain rows in the crop are not sown with the aim of providing a slowly available supply of soil moisture during periods of low rainfall. In the past, the OZCOT cotton crop simulation model has been used with long-term climate records to assess the impact of different management strategies for irrigated cotton production and to study the prospects for rainfed cotton production in the major cotton growing regions. In this paper, we present modifications made to OZCOT to better accommodate skip row. First, a simple procedure previously used to approximate light interception of row crops was assessed for its ability to enhance the capability of OZCOT to simulate skip row configurations and second, a modification to allow for the possibility that water in the skip is not as freely available as the water in the plant row was also explored. Including modifications to allow for differences in soil water extraction significantly improved predictions of crop yield for cotton in skip row configurations across a number of locations in the Eastern Australian cotton producing regions, but modifications to account for light interception in row configurations reduced the ability of the model to simulate skip row cotton yields. The modified model gave reasonable predictions of yield for solid planted and skip row crops. The performance was within the range of results published for solid planted crops over a range of nitrogen and irrigation treatments and planting dates. The model's simulation of skip row yields when compared to solid planted crops grown under the same conditions, eflected the relationships seen in the measured data and those published in the industry literature.

	shorttitle = {The impact of trash management on sugarcane production and nitrogen management},
	abstract = {Trash blankets contain substantial amounts of nitrogen (N) and other nutrients. The availability of N in trash is complicated because most of the N cycles through the soil organic matter. To gain insights into the impacts of trash management on sugarcane production and the long-term fate of N contained in trash, a simulation study was conducted with the APSIM-Sugarcane cropping systems model. Simulations were conducted over 100 years for 3 different soil types combined with climatic data from five locations from Bundaberg to Tully, Queensland, Australia. Trash management (burnt and green cane trash blanket (GCTB)) and N fertilizer application rates (ranging from 0 to 300 kg/ha) were varied in the simulations. The simulation study showed that sugarcane yields have potential to respond positively to trash retention in the range of environments considered. However, achieving these higher potential yields will require that N applications not be reduced following the switch from a burnt to GCTB system. This study also illustrates the potential negative, short-term impact of trash blanketing on sugarcane yields due to the immobilization of N by the decomposing trash. After at least 5 years, the system comes into a new equilibrium with sufficient N supply in the soil-crop system to allow the trash to decompose without creating N deficits. Implications of this period of disequilibrium on the results of short-term trash management trials and the transition from burnt to GCTB systems are discussed. The results of the simulations also indicate that average environmental losses of N are likely to be greater from GCTB systems at all rates of N fertilizer applications and that particular care should be exercised to avoid over-application of N in GCTB systems.},

	doi = {10.1071/AR03219},
	abstract = {The area of canola is expanding in the wheat-based farming systems of the summer-dominant rainfall zone of the Australian wheatbelt. Despite this, there is little information on yield and oil content expectations in relation to rainfall, location, and soil type and the reliability of the crop in a region characterised by high climatic variability. In this paper we assess variation in profitability of canola production in locations with different rainfall in the north-eastern wheatbelt by using long-term simulations at 4 locations spanning the climatic range of the region (Gunnedah, Moree, Walgett, Roma) with a validated model (APSIM-Canola). A new semi-mechanistic method for simulating oil content, accounting for temperature and water deficit effects during grain filling, is described and tested. Key agronomic determinants of reliable grain yield and oil content are identified. Long-term simulations showed strong effects of location, plant-available soil water at sowing ( PAW), and in-crop rainfall on grain yield expectations. Yield was negatively related to sowing date, particularly in those situations of high water supply ( PAW and in-crop rainfall). Grain yield was positively related to in-crop rainfall up to 300 mm, with water use efficiency in most seasons falling between 6 and 12 kg/ha.mm. Variation in oil content was most strongly affected by sowing date, followed by location, with PAW having a minor effect. Importantly, the price bonus cut-off for oil content of 42\% was exceeded in 25, 40, 40, and 55\% of seasons for Roma, Walgett, Moree, and Gunnedah, respectively. Negative and falling phases of the SOI in April-May were associated with lower grain yield and oil contents, whereas positive and rising phases with higher grain yield and oil content. This suggests that the choice to sow canola over other alternatives could be a tactical decision that depends upon the seasonal climate outlook. The approach used in this paper can be applied to the analysis of canola production risk ( yield and oil content) and profitability in other prospective environments.},

	abstract = {Vapour pressure deficit (VPD) has a significant effect on the amount of water required by the crop to maintain optimal growth. Data required to calculate the mean VPD on a daily basis are rarely available, and most models use approximations to estimate it. In APSIM ( Agricultural Production Systems Simulator), VPD is estimated from daily maximum and minimum temperatures with the assumption that the minimum temperature equals dew point, and there is little change in vapour pressure or dew point during any one day. The accuracy of such VPD estimations was assessed using data collected every 15 min near Wagga Wagga in New South Wales, Australia. Actual vapour pressure of the air ranged from 0.5 to 2.5 kPa. For more than 75\% of the time its variation was less than 20\%, and the maximum variation was up to 50\%. Daytime mean VPD ranged from 0 to 5.3 kPa. Daily minimum temperature was found to be a poor estimate of dew point temperature, being higher than dew point in summer and lower in winter. Thus the prediction of vapour pressure was poor. Vapour pressure at 0900 hours was a better estimate of daily mean vapour pressure. Despite the poor estimation of vapour pressure, daytime mean VPD was predicted reasonably well using daily maximum and minimum temperatures. If the vapour pressure at 0900 hours from the SILO Patched Point Dataset was used as the actual daily mean vapour pressure, the accuracy of daytime VPD estimation was further improved. Simulations using historical weather data for 1957 - 2002 show that such improved accuracy in daytime VPD estimation slightly increased simulated crop yield and deep drainage, while slightly reducing crop water uptake. Comparison of the APSIM RUE/TE and CERES-Wheat approaches for modelling potential transpiration revealed differences in crop water demand estimated by the two approaches. Although the differences had a small effect on the probability distribution of simulated long-term wheat yield, water uptake, and deep drainage, this finding highlights the need for a scientific re-appraisal of the APSIM RUE/TE and energy balance approaches for the estimation of crop demand, which will have implications for modelling crop growth under water-limited conditions and calculation of water required to maintain maximum growth.},

	abstract = {Collaboration of researchers and service providers with farmers in addressing crop and soil management, using on-farm experiments and cropping system simulation, was negotiated in 2 districts in Central Queensland, Australia. The 2 most influential variables affecting crop productivity in this region ( soil water and mineral nitrogen contents) and the growth of sown crops, were monitored and simulated for 3 years beginning in December 1992. Periodic soil sampling of large experimental strips on 3 farms, from paddocks that differed in cropping history and soil properties, provided robust datasets of change, over time, of soil water and mineral nitrogen status. Farmers participated in twice-yearly discussions with researchers, informed by the accumulating data, which influenced thinking about soil behaviour and possible new management strategies. As the study period coincided with a prolonged drought, so that cropping opportunities were few, the objectives of the work were modified to concentrate almost exclusively on the soil variables. The contribution of the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator, which was used to simulate the measured changes in soil water and mineral nitrogen, was found by all participants to be useful. The APSIM output generally demonstrated close correspondence with field observations, which raised confidence in its applicability to local cropping systems. Exploration of hypothetical situations of interest to farmer participants, in the form of what-if scenarios, provided insights into the behaviour of the production system for a range of soil and seasonal conditions. The informed speculation of the simulator became a substitute for the farmers' own, more tentative, efforts. The regular participative review sessions proved to be highly effective in stimulating the learning of both farmers and researchers. The farmers were able to feel comfortable as owners of the collaborative experiments and custodians of the learning environment. Clear evidence for the ongoing learning of these farmers appeared in post-collaboration practices and experiences.},

The NWHEAT model satisfactorily predicted above-ground dry matter, leaf area index and grain yields for both crops in rotations with either grassy ( Grass) or medic ( Medic) pastures, including the lack of significant response of yield to nitrogen fertiliser applied to wheat at sowing. Simulation data for soil water, from SOILWAT2, was consistent with measured data. Simulation with SOILN2, however, largely underestimated soil nitrogen, due to excessive uptake by the simulated wheat during the season when nitrogen was abundant and water supply readily available. Thus, the soil nitrate had to be reset at sowing for the following barley crop; simulated soil nitrate agreed with the measured data in this season when this nutrient was low. For most variables of crop growth and soil water, the simulated data were mostly within 2 standard errors of the measured means. Prediction of grain protein was underestimated in all cases, including where nitrogen in the shoot was overestimated. This was possibly due to inadequate remobilisation of nitrogen from the straw and roots to the grain by the simulated crop. A satisfactory prediction of dry matter, grain yield and grain weight was obtained for wheat when the models were extended to other trials at Roseworthy ( Lower North), Minnipa ( Upper Eyre Peninsula) and Wunkar ( Murray Mallee), based on limited soil data.

	abstract = {Soil nitrogen (N) supply in the Vertosols of southern Queensland, Australia has steadily declined as a result of long-term cereal cropping without N fertiliser application or rotations with legumes. Nitrogen-fixing legumes such as lucerne may enhance soil N supply and therefore could be used in lucerne-wheat rotations. However, lucerne leys in this subtropical environment can create a soil moisture deficit, which may persist for a number of seasons. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of varying the duration of a lucerne ley (for up to 4 years) on soil N increase, N supply to wheat, soil water changes, wheat yields and wheat protein on a fertility-depleted Vertosol in a field experiment between 1989 and 1996 at Warra (26degrees47'S, 150degrees53'E), southern Queensland. The experiment consisted of a wheat-wheat rotation, and 8 treatments of lucerne leys starting in 1989 (phase 1) or 1990 (phase 2) for 1, 2, 3 or 4 years duration, followed by wheat cropping. Lucerne DM yield and N yield increased with increasing duration of lucerne leys. Soil N increased over time following 2 years of lucerne but there was no further significant increase after 3 or 4 years of lucerne ley. Soil nitrate concentrations increased significantly with all lucerne leys and moved progressively downward in the soil profile from 1992 to 1995. Soil water, especially at 0.9-1.2 m depth, remained significantly lower for the next 3 years after the termination of the 4-year lucerne ley than under continuous wheat. No significant increase in wheat yields was observed from 1992 to 1995, irrespective of the lucerne ley. However, wheat grain protein concentrations were significantly higher under lucerne-wheat than under wheat-wheat rotations for 3-5 years. The lucerne yield and soil water and nitrate-N concentrations were satisfactorily simulated with the APSIM model. Although significant N accretion occurred in the soil following lucerne leys, in drier seasons, recharge of the drier soil profile following long duration lucerne occurred after 3 years. Consequently, 3- and 4-year lucerne-wheat rotations resulted in more variable wheat yields than wheat-wheat rotations in this region. The remaining challenge in using lucerne-wheat rotations is balancing the N accretion benefits with plant-available water deficits, which are most likely to occur in the highly variable rainfall conditions of this region.},

	abstract = {Crop yield in Western Australia (WA) is limited by water. Each millimeter used can potentially produce 20 kg grain/ha. Temporal variations in grain yield are therefore mostly driven by seasonal rainfall. In addition to seasonal variability, spatial variability occurs within the field and areas of low, average and high yields can usually be identified by growers and confirmed by satellite imagery and yield mapping. Measurements in a typical field showed that the spatial pattern of grain yield matched that of bulk soil electrical conductivity measured by EM38. A good match also occurred between yield and the spatial pattern of gamma-ray emission from natural 40K. In rock-free areas of WA's highly weathered wheatbelt soils, emission from 40K is related to clay content. This in turn governs soil moisture retention. It therefore seemed that the soil's capacity to retain moisture was a major landscape-factor controlling yield. Soil moisture retention capacities were measured in a range of low to high crop yielding areas by sampling down to 2 m at the drained upper limit (equivalent to field capacity) and crop lower limit (at maximum moisture extraction by plants). Plant available water (PAW) was calculated as the amount of water stored between the drained upper and crop lower limits. Crop yield normalized over several years was linearly related to PAW. Crop modelling using APSIM confirmed the importance of PAW and its interaction with seasonal rainfall to determine both spatial and temporal variability in grain yield.},

Previous research has shown that lodging can reduce yields by as much as 25\%. As far as is known, the effect of lodging on yield response to irrigation has not been considered. Growers need to assess yield and profit benefits before purchasing or storing more water and current estimates of yield responses to increased allocation could be misleading. The APSIM-Sugarcane model was used to estimate such responses but these estimates do not take lodging into account because crop and climatic triggers for lodging have not yet been established. There is little published experimental data on marginal yield response to increased allocation. In recognition of this, two experiments (1 and 2) were conducted in the Burdekin, Queensland, Australia, where responses to allocations of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 ML/ha were measured. Each allocation was scheduled in the best possible way. An unlimited treatment was also included. In a third experiment at Bambaroo, three levels of irrigation (0.2, 1.1 and 1.7 ML/ha) were applied. Yield response to irrigation was measured at various stages of development and at harvest in all three experiments. The APSIM-Sugarcane model was set up to simulate these experiments and long-term simulations were done for the Burdekin to assess climatic and crop conditions for lodging. Simulation of the Burdekin experiments with APSIM-Sugarcane indicated that yield responses to irrigation in December and February were 'normal' in terms of the physiology of sugarcane as captured in the model. However, when the crop was harvested (July 2002 and August 2003), the high allocation treatments yielded far less than expected. The lack of response above 4 ML/ha was explained by invoking lodging rules based on crop biomass, rainfall and antecedent soil moisture. Lodging can be controlled to some extent by irrigation. The results have important implications for decisions about investment in irrigation infrastructure including on-farm dams. Lodging and consequent yield loss due to irrigation increases the risk of investments in supplementary irrigation in a way that may not have been considered before. Lodging may mean that high volumes of water may not always be required in some situations in full irrigation schemes even when the rainfall is low.},

	abstract = {Subsoil chemical constraints, including varying combinations of salinity, alkalinity, and high concentrations of boron and sodium, are widespread in southern Australia. We combined field and simulation experiments to: (a) quantify the effect of subsoil chemical constraints on the lower limit of plant available water in sandy regolithic, hypocalcic, calcarosols, (b) assess the ability of current modelling approaches to account for the effects of chemically inhospitable soils on crop yield and water budget, and (c) investigate the interactions between subsoil constraints and rainfall. Lower limits were derived from measurements of soil water content using frequency domain reflectometry in an experiment combining three rotations, two locations, and three seasons (Experiment 1), and from gravimetric measurements in fanner-managed crops during three to four seasons (Experiment 2). A two-step method was used accounting for the effect of clay content on lower limits, and analysing the residuals against likely constraints. Significant, positive associations between residuals and chemical constraints (Na, B, carbonates, pH) indicated lower limits greater than expected from texture, and less plant available water with increasing intensity of constraints. These empirical functions can be used in modelling, and in estimating target yields for management purposes. Yield and soil water content simulated with the APSIM model were compared with measured wheat yield (range: 0.6-3.7 t ha(-1)), and measured soil water content in wheat and canola crops (range: 0.0 10-0.205 cm(3) cm(-3)). These comparisons indicated that in soils with clay content less than or equal to31\%, electrical conductivity (EC) less than or equal to 1.31 dS m(-1), pH(water) less than or equal to10.3, concentration of CaCO3 less than or equal to292 g kg(-1), B less than or equal to29 mg kg(-1), and Na less than or equal to2450 mg kg(-1), crop responses to subsoil constraints can be largely accounted for by higher lower limits and reduced crop transpiration. Higher B concentration would require accounting for reduced transpiration efficiency. Interactions between subsoil constraints and seasonal rainfall (April-October) were analysed in a simulation experiment including the factorial combination of 39 locations, 44 seasons and two soil profiles (with or without chemical constraints). Three types of site-dependent responses were found. Yield reduction caused by subsoil constraints was independent of seasonal rainfall in 18 locations (neutral response), was more severe in wetter seasons in eight locations (negative response), and decreased with increasing rainfall in 13 locations (positive response). Negative responses were more frequent in sites where conditions contributed to severe water deficits, i.e. lower seasonal rainfall, less available soil water at sowing, and greater evaporative demand. Estimates based on the assumption of a flat landscape with good soil infiltration leading to little runoff, showed that increase in deep drainage accounted for most of the reduction in crop transpiration associated with subsoil constraints. For a given amount of seasonal rainfall, the likelihood of a drainage event and its average size both increased with increasing frequency of large rainfall events, as characterised using power laws.

	abstract = {Grain yields of rainfed agriculture in Australia are often low and vary substantially from season to season. Assimilates stored prior to grain filling have been identified as important contributors to grain yield in such environments, but quantifying their benefit has been hampered by inadequate methods and large seasonal variability. APSIM-Nwheat is a crop system simulation model, consisting of modules that incorporate aspects of soil water, nitrogen (N), crop residues, crop growth and development. Model outputs were compared with detailed measurements of N fertilizer experiments on loamy soils at three locations in southern New South Wales, Australia. The field measurements allowed the routine for remobilization of assimilates stored prior to grain filling in the model to be tested for the first time and simulations showed close agreement with observed data. Analysing system components indicated that with increasing yield, both the observed and simulated absolute amount of remobilization generally increased while the relative contribution to grain yield decreased. The simulated relative contribution of assimilates stored prior to grain filling to grain yield also decreased with increasing availability of water after anthesis. The model, linked to long-term historical weather records was used to analyse yield benefits from assimilates stored prior to grain filling under rainfed conditions at a range of locations in the main wheat growing areas of Australia. Simulation results highlighted that in each of these locations assimilates stored prior to grain filling often contributed a significant proportion to grain yield. The simulated contribution of assimilates stored prior to grain filling to grain yield can amount to several tonnes per hectare, however, it varied substantially from 5 - 90\% of grain yield depending on seasonal rainfall amount and distribution, N supply, crop growth and seasonal water use. High N application often reduced the proportion of water available after anthesis and decreased the relative contribution of remobilization to grain yield as long as grain yields increased, particularly on soils with greater water-holding capacity. Increasing the capacity or potential to accumulate pre-grain filling assimilates for later remobilization by 20\% increased yields by a maximum of 12\% in moderate seasons with terminal droughts, but had little effect in poor or very good seasons in which factors that affect the amount of carbohydrates stored rather than the storage capacity itself appeared to limit grain yield. These factors were, little growth due to water or N deficit in the weeks prior to and shortly after anthesis ( when most of the assimilates accumulate for later remobilization), poor sink demand of grains due to low grain number as a result of little pre-anthesis growth or high photosynthetic rate during grain filling. Increasing the potential storage capacity for remobilization is expected to increase grain yield especially under conditions of terminal drought.},

	doi = {10.1016/S0378-4290(03)00069-8},
	abstract = {Sugar industries in Australia and Swaziland rely on irrigation to a large extent (60 and 100\%, respectively) to produce a viable crop. Some large irrigation schemes are vulnerable to degradation of ground water quality and it is important to have reliable estimates of water use in order to better calculate runoff and drainage losses from sugarcane fields. It is also important to improve estimates of crop water use in order to improve irrigation design parameters and scheduling. Matching water supply and demand on a daily or weekly basis is essential for productivity and sustainability in any irrigation scheme. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation has recently produced clear guidelines ('FAO 56') on determination of water requirements for a number of crops including sugarcane. Two process-level models, APSIM and CANEGRO are being used to support various decisions regarding the use of irrigation in sugarcane. The aims of this research were to confirm or otherwise refine FAO 56 crop coefficients for sugarcane, to refine simulation of water use in the APSIM-Sugarcane model and to assess the reference evapotranspiration (ET) procedure from the CANEGRO model now used in Swaziland for irrigation scheduling and system design. Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) systems were installed in the Burdekin district, Australia and in Swaziland to determine daily ET from well-irrigated sugarcane crops. Automatic weather stations were installed within I km of the BREB systems in order to determine ET0 according to FAO 56. Radiation interception and biomass accumulation were measured in the Australian experiment. The results from the two countries provided a sound basis for confirmation of the current FAO 56 crop coefficients for sugarcane during 'initial' (0.4) and 'mid' (1.25) growth phases. The FAO 56 crop coefficient for the 'final' stage (0.7) was not supported. Instead a value of 1.25 is suggested for working out the water balance. However, 0.7 may be desirable for irrigation scheduling in order to impose some stress on the crop and so enhance sucrose content. Transpiration use efficiency for A-PSIM-Sugarcane was increased from 8.0 to 8.7 g kPa kg(-1) on the basis of the Australian results. The reference ET procedure was supported equally by the new BREB measurements in Swaziland and by the original lysimeter data but the new data indicated that systematic improvements to the reference procedure could be made.

	abstract = {Subsurface soil acidity reduces the growth of roots, which can potentially decrease crop yields. However, the magnitude of these yield reductions is dependent on interactions between factors such as the depth and severity of subsurface soil acidity, plant resistance to acidity, and water and nutrient availability. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) was used to examine effects of these factors and their interactions on wheat yields in the Mediterranean climatic regions of Western Australia. The model was linked to historical meteorological data of the region ( up to 90 different seasons), and was run for three locations representing low, medium and high rainfall zones and three constant but contrasting soil acidity profiles in a deep sandy soil with two wheat cultivars differing in aluminium (Al) resistance. The simulated results showed inherently high variability between seasons in grain yield, rooting depth and nitrogen leaching. Subsurface soil acidity could decrease average grain yields by up to 60\%, particularly in soil profiles with acidity in deep layers. The adverse effects of acidity on wheat yields were greater in the high than the low rainfall zone. Amelioration of acidity by 75\% in the entire profile or in the top 20-cm layer improved the yield of the Al-sensitive wheat cultivar. Growing Al-resistant wheat partially eliminated the negative effects of acidity on yields in soils with severe subsurface acidity and almost fully eliminated these negative effects in soils with moderate subsurface acidity. The yield benefits arising from growing Al-resistant wheat were greater than those from ameliorating acidity in the 0 - 20 cm layer by liming. Increasing nitrogen input increased yields of both Al-sensitive and Al-resistant wheat grown in acid soils in all the rainfall zones, but the yield increments were much greater in the high than the low rainfall zones. Applications of nitrogen fertilisers mitigate the effect of acidity on yields of Al-sensitive wheat in soils with shallow ( 10 - 40 cm) subsurface acidity. Furthermore, the improved yield by growing Al-resistant wheat and amelioration of acidity was correlated with increased rooting depth and was associated with decreased nitrogen leaching. Possible agronomic management options to combat the subsurface acidity problem are discussed.},

The approach is based on current understanding, but allows for future advances in knowledge to be incorporated into the methodology as it becomes available.

The simulation results indicate that burning is the greatest source of greenhouse gas emissions during primary production and that the optimum production per unit of greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved at the paddock scale by introducing GCTB and a legume fallow into the cropping system. An economic analysis of the potential differences between private benefits, i.e. revenue from cane production, and public benefits, i.e. carbon sequestration, associated with each scenario indicates that the greatest financial benefits can be accrued to both sectors when GCTB and fallow periods are incorporated into the cropping system.},

Breeders have tried to incorporate early vigor by selecting for increased specific leaf area (SLA). A crop simulation model (APSIM-Nwheat) was used to evaluate the role of SLA on potential yield. Increased early vigor was simulated by increasing the SLA trait in the model. Grain yields were simulated for the mediterranean climate of Western Australia with winter-dominant rainfall, for New South Wales with evenly distributed rainfall, and for Queensland with a subtropical climate with summer-dominant rainfall. Independent, multiseason simulations were-performed with historical weather-records. The largest average yield increase with greater SLA was 15\% on the sandy soil in Western Australia but only with additional N inputs. In the low-rainfall region of Western Australia, with low N input. a yield increase of up to 5\% was achieved on the sandy soil while yield responses were negative on the clay soil. With increased N application, the SLA trait increased yields. by up, to 7\% on the clay soils in this region. The increased SLA trait failed to increase yields and even decreased Yields on average in New South Wales and in Queensland, except in above-average rainfall seasons and only at high N application.

To provide information on site-specific risk of deep drainage at a landholder scale, spatially variable deep drainage beneath an annual crop was estimated for a catchment of approximately 25000 ha. The method coupled the results from one-dimensional crop simulation modelling (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator) with probabilistic soil mapping (Expector). Annual deep drainage over the catchment averaged 18 mm, representing 5\% of rainfall. The annual deep drainage for the most probable soil types averaged 25 mm for acid loamy sand, 19 mm for yellow duplex, 14 mm for loamy sand, and 12 mm for red duplex. Groundwater modelling (Flowtube) highlighted that the groundwater table below the flat valley is not likely to be lowered with the introduction of perennial vegetation upslope. However, scenario spatial modelling indicated that replacing vegetation in areas of the most drainage-prone soil types, acid loamy sand (22\% of catchment) and acid loamy sand plus yellow duplex (together at 48\% of catchment area), was predicted to reduce annual average deep drainage by 38 and 60\%, respectively. Mapping deep drainage by this method is of value to land managers who want to reduce deep drainage by locating priority areas for the establishment of perennial vegetation.},

	doi = {10.1071/EA00163},
	abstract = {Two issues prompted this paper. The first was the measured soil organic carbon decline in fertile northern Australian soils under continual cropping using traditional management practices. We wanted to see whether it was theoretically possible to maintain or improve soil organic carbon concentrations with modern management recommendations. The second was the debate about use of sustainability indicators for on-farm management, so we looked at soil organic carbon as a potential indicator of soil health and investigated whether it was useful in making on-farm crop decisions. The analytical results indicated first that theoretically the observed decline in soil organic carbon concentrations in some northern cracking clay soils can be halted and reversed under continuous cropping sequences by using best practice management. Second, the results and associated discussion give some support to the use of soil organic carbon as a sustainability indicator for soil health. There was a consistent correlation between crop input decisions ( fertilisation, stubble management, tillage), outputs ( yield and profits) and outcomes ( change in soil organic carbon content) in the short and longer term. And this relationship depended to some extent on whether the existing soil organic carbon status was low, medium or high. A stock dynamics relationship is one where the change in a stock ( such as soil organic carbon) through time is related not only to the management decisions made and other random influences ( such as climatic effects), but also to the concentration or level of the stock itself in a previous time period. Against such a requirement, soil organic carbon was found to be a reasonable measure. However, the inaccuracy in measuring soil organic carbon in the paddock mitigates the potential benefit shown in this analysis of using soil organic carbon as a sustainability indicator. These results are based on a simulation model (APSIM) calibrated for a cracking clay (Vertosol) soil typical of much of the intensively-cropped slopes and plains region of northern New South Wales and southern Queensland, and need to be interpreted in this light. There are large areas of such soils in north-western New South Wales; however, many of these experience lower rainfalls and plant-available soil water capacities than in this case, and the importance of these characteristics must also be considered.},

The biophysical characteristics of the study area and an overview of the methods used to determine the productivity and deep drainage of various cropping/pasture systems in the Liverpool Plains are discussed. Also covered are the preliminary APSIM (agricultural production systems simulator model) water balance and productivity and a field experimentation conducted at the Hudson research site which aims to quantify the production, nutrient movement and water balance of cropping systems with varying lengths of fallow and perennial pastures, spanning the range of the most leaky to the least leaky systems. The various methods for temporal and spatial extrapolation of deep drainage estimates and the long-term simulations of alternative land uses at the Hudson site and for the Liverpool catchment are discussed. The sensitivity of the experimental results and simulations to the sowing rules (Vertosols in low ({\textless}670 mm/year) and in high ({\textgreater}670 mm/year) rainfall areas and non-Vertosols) and the annual variability of production and gross margins relative to other cropping systems are also discussed. Some possible land use strategies were assessed in terms of their ability to reduce the volume of excess water (drainage+runoff) and to increase profits from cropping on a sub-catchment wide basis. These strategies for land use change need to be designed for individual sub-catchments depending on the reduction in drainage volume necessary to prevent of decrease the risk of salinity and the relative areas of the various land mapping units. The comparison of results with alternative estimates of deep drainage is also presented.

	abstract = {This chapter describes how incorporation of a proton budget framework into two simulation models (GRAZPLAN and APSIM) of agricultural systems can provide with tools to analyse soil acidification as a function of soil, climate, and agricultural management. Some relevant concepts of soil acidification are reviewed. GRAZPLAN is a suite of decision support tools aimed at helping farmers manage grazing enterprises. APSIM was originally designed as a tool for systems research, allowing a combination of different soil, crop and pasture models to simulate soil and crop management dynamically using conditional rules. The implementation of the Helyar-Porter proton budget framework in the two agricultural systems models implies a change from the whole profile approach taken by most experimental studies to that of a multilayered soil system. The corresponding changes in the system boundaries require modification of the definitions of some of the proton budget, as well as additional term for root excretion, inclusion of returned residues in the addition of organic anions (OA ad) term, and calculation of transport of acidity (including aluminium) between layers. Two case studies are presented illustrating the use of APSIM-SoilpH and GRAZPLAN soil acidity model. In the first case study, simulations of the wheat experiment conducted at the Charles Sturt University near Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, Australia, are discussed to simulate the use of APSIM-SoilpH. The model is also used to study the pH profile development over 12-year period and to determine the effects of fertilizer management. The second case study illustrates the application of GRAZPLAN soil acidity model to data from the landmark research on soil acidification under subterranean clover ( Trifolium subterraneum)-based pastures in the catchment of the Pejar dam near Crookwell, New South Wales. It also demonstrates that the GRAZPLAN model can be applied to understanding the relative importance of the processes contributing to soil acidification and illustrates some of the issues yet to be resolved in modelling these processes. The implementation of the Helyar and Porter proton budget calculations in two agricultural systems models improves on the manual application of the framework and presents more opportunities of soil acidification in agricultural systems. As illustrated in the APSIM-SoilpH case study, use of the model for extrapolations in time can put the results and conditions of a short-term experimental study in perspective. Similarly, in the second case study the GRAZPLAN soil acidity model allows an analysis of processes occurring between experimental sampling dates, such as the non-linear increase in total soil nitrogen. Both APSIM-SoilpH and the GRAZPLAN soil acidity model provide opportunities to analyse options for amelioration of soil acidity and to assist in management that will minimize soil acidification.},

	abstract = {The Lower Burdekin Delta (LBD) is located on the dry-tropical coastal strip in North Queensland, Australia. The region is Australia's largest sugar producing area with approximately 38,000 hectares of land under sugarcane. However, the LBD also borders the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA). Thus industry, community, and federal, regulatory and environmental organisations are interested in ascertaining the magnitude of nitrate leaching from the root zone and potential implications for the GBRWHA, Direct measurement of nitrate leaching is problematic, thus it is likely that modelling will play an ever-increasing role in guiding experimental work and decision-making. The difficulty in monitoring nitrate leaching also raises concerns with respect to capturing data for the purpose of calibrating and verifying models. However, other crop/soil parameters that directly affect the amount of nitrate leaching are more readily measured (e.g., soil hydraulic properties, matric potential, crop yield, fertilizer application timing, and initial soil N). Thus, parameterising/calibrating a model to such data raises the expectation that associated model outputs related to nitrate leaching will be useful. We used APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator), with constituent crop-growth, soil-water, and nitrogen transformation modules (Sugar, APSIM-SWIM, Soiln2) to model the 2001/2002 sugarcane ratoon crop at Kalamia, field 48, within the LBD and found the measured and modelled soil water nitrate loads at 1.5 m depth to be of a similar order. This result suggests that the modelled nitrate leaching values are likely to be indicative of the magnitude of nitrate leaching that occurs under field 48. Subsequent sensitivity analyses identified the timing and mode of fertilizer application as key parameters over which management control might be exploited to minimise the flux of nitrate to groundwater.},

	title = {Applying a spatial modelling framework to assess land use effects on catchment hydrology},
	abstract = {Sustainable land use and management requires an understanding of the processes of recharge, discharge and salt movement across the landscape. Evaluation of land use changes on different parts of the catchment requires the application of farming system models in a catchment context to assess the implications of different scenarios on water and salt balance of the catchment. In this study we have developed a spatial modelling framework capable of incorporating farming system models (I-D) applied to land units with hydrological (lateral) connections between adjacent units in a catchment. The framework was applied to Simmons Creek catchment, a sub-catchment of the Billabong Creek in southern NSW comprising gentle uplands and substantial low relief areas containing swamps. An integrated approach incorporating soil, hydrology, hydrogeology, and terrain analysis resulted in interpretation of landscape function and the necessary parameterisation of the modelling framework. APSIM was used as the fanning system model in this study with SOILWAT2 as the soil water balance module, modified for lateral flow connections (surface and subsurface flows). Current land use (crop rotation and pasture) and an alternative land use (10\% trees on uphill units and pasture in the lower lying lands) were simulated. The results of the modelling showed the relative contribution of parts of the catchment in total recharge. Comparison between current and alternative land use over 44 years of simulations indicated a decrease of mean annual drainage from 39 to 29 mm/yr and an average reduction of the groundwater level of about 0.4 m. More substantial decrease in water table depth would require targeted tree planting over larger areas. These can be investigated further with the spatial framework.},

	title = {Exploring profit - {Sustainability} trade-offs in cropping systems using evolutionary algorithms},
	abstract = {Models that implement the bio-physical components of agro-ecosystems are ideally suited for exploring sustainability issues in cropping systems. Sustainability may be represented as a number of objectives to be maximized or minimized. Models provide a means to evaluate system performance for alternative strategic, tactical and operational decisions. The full decision space is usually very large and simplifications based on insight into agronomic relations and fanning practice are necessary to safeguard computational feasibility. Different optimisation approaches have been proposed in the literature, usually based on mathematical programming techniques. The disadvantage of these techniques is that they can only deal with greatly simplified system descriptions, thus excluding the direct use of bio-physical system models. Here, we present a global search approach based on an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). We introduce a multiobjective evaluation technique within this EA framework, linking the optimisation procedure to the APSIM cropping systems model, and perform simulations in parallel over an existing computer network. A case study addressing crop choice and sowing rules in north-east Australian cropping systems is used to illustrate the EA methodology. Sustainability of these systems is evaluated in terms of economic performance (gross margin, financial risk) and resource use (erosion). Because of the limited size of the problem, the quality of the EA optimisation can be assessed by comparison to a large sample of the full problem domain. Results demonstrate that the EA procedure, parameterized with generic parameters from the literature converges to a useable solution set within a reasonable amount of time. Frontier "peels" or pareto-optimal solutions as described by the multiobjective evaluation procedure provide useful information for discussion on trade-offs between conflicting objectives. Application to a more realistic decision problem is recommended to evaluate the usefulness of the approach in informing discussions on agro-ecosystem design.},

	title = {Assessing the economic and environmental benefits and risks of investing in recycled water for irrigation on the {Darling} {Downs}, {Australia}},
	abstract = {Crop production in much of Australia is strongly influenced by the availability of water. Rainfall is highly variable in both amount and distribution and, as a result, so too are supplies of irrigation water from existing sources such as overland flow (catchment runoff), rivers and bores. The search for additional sources of irrigation water, coupled with the need for urban communities to dispose of large quantities of treated recycled water has led to increasing interest from communities in the reticulation of this recycled water to adjacent crop production areas for irrigation purposes. Proposals to use recycled water inevitably lead to a complex range of production, economic and environmental issues. Computer-based simulation models can capture many of the key factors and processes influencing such systems, and hence can play a useful role in exploring these issues. In this paper, we describe an approach that couples farming system and economic models, in a way that enables analysis of the likely benefits and risks of investing in recycled water. The paper includes a case study based on a farm in the Darling Downs, Queensland, which has a mixture of crop and irrigation sources.},

A lucerne field experiment was conducted on the well-fertilized Heilu soil (a sandy loam of loess deposits or the Los-Orthic Entisols) during 1985-1987 at the Qingyang Research Station, Gansu, China. The experiment consisted of three different cutting regimes (cutting at bud, early flowering, and late flowering). Flowering data was well simulated with the module except for the first harvest in 1987 spring. Compared with observed data, dry matter yield was well simulated for early and late flowering harvest treatments, but, for bud treatment, dry matter yield was poorly simulated as the effect of cutting on biomass partitioning to the roots is currently not included in the model. Overall, the APSIM-Lucerne module simulated growth and production of strongly winter-dormant lucerne growing in Gansu, China well. Further improvements to model performance in the area of lucerne phenology, growth and its impact on soil water and nitrogen dynamics are necessary in order to capture the observed growth and development of lucerne in Gansu and its subsequent impact on crop production, and evaluate climate and market risk associated with changing from current to forage legume-based cropping systems.},

This study found that the water use of sorghum echoes rainfall during the growing season, although occasionally water use can be substantially higher. Grain production is risky due to variable summer rainfall distribution while forages are a safer alternative with APSIM predicting commercial levels of production attainable in many years if sowing is complete by end December.

Possible future environmental change scenarios for 2080 were generated from the output of 9 climate models including GCMs (General Circulation Models) and RCMs (Regional Climate Models), historical climate records (SILO) and IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) SRES (Special Report on Emission Scenarios) for Roseworthy. Plant available water capacity for a typical soil in Roseworthy was derived from the state soils database (Maschmedt, pers comm.). The APSIM (Agricultural Production System Simulator) Wheat module was run for the historical climate record (baseline) and eighty possible environmental change scenarios. A wheat crop was simulated for each year of a 100-year period under each environmental scenario. A critical economic yield was derived from current input costs, grain prices, and standard return on investment (3\%) and resulted in a critical yield for Roseworthy of 1 870 kg/ha. The conditional probability of not exceeding the critical yield increased from 27\% (low level risk) of years under the historical baseline to 35-50\% (medium level risk) of years under the most probable environmental change scenario. This result indicates that some solid adaptation strategies should be put forward to deal with the increased risk associated with Roseworthy wheat production.},

	abstract = {The root-parasitic weeds Orobanche spp. infect a wide variety of crops in the Mediterranean region and have already invaded other regions with similar climatic conditions such as south Australia. Hence, a parasite module was developed within the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) and parameterized for simulation of development and growth of O. crenata. Faba bean was chosen as a host crop to study the impact of O. crenata infestation on its growth and yield formation. In the model, we assume that O. crenata acts simply as an additional sink for assimilates and does not influence the host crop metabolism. The parasite carbon demand is calculated from the total number of parasite attachments and the potential growth rate of an individual O. crenata. The amount of dry matter partitioned into O. crenata is simulated based on the carbon demand and carbon availability of the host crop by assuming that O. crenata has a sink priority higher than vegetative faba bean organs, but lower than the grain bearing pods. Simulations were run with the new parasite module and the modified APSIM-Faba bean module against experimental data from Tel Hadya in northwest Syria. The results indicated that APSIM-Faba bean module was able to simulate the faba bean biomass growth and yield formation. The parasite module, together with APSIM-Faba bean, was capable of predicting the biomass accumulation of O. crenata and the yield loss of infected faba bean plants for various infestation levels and faba bean sowing dates, as well as under different water supply conditions. Such a model can assist in the development of a systems approach to reduce negative impact of parasitic weeds.},

With this paper we tested two basic hypothesis that could lead to improve the predictive capacity of APSIM-wheat in the region, i.e. (A) root exploration within a particular soil layer can be reduced by the presence of toxic concentrations of salts, and (B) soil water uptake from a particular soil layer can be reduced by high concentration of salts through osmotic effects. Despite the soils had high levels of salinity, sodicity and boron, the observed variability in root abundance at different soil layers was mainly related to soil salinity. We concluded that (i) whether the impact of subsoil limitations on growth and yield of wheat in the Victorian Mallee should be explained through toxic, osmotic or both effects acting simultaneously still requires further research, (ii) at present, the performance of APSIM-Wheat in the region can be improved either by assuming increased values of lower limit for soil water extraction, or by modifying the pattern of root exploration in the soil profile both as a function of soil salinity.},

Grain yield in skip row treatments was equal to or greater than that of solid plant treatments at yield levels below about 2.5 t/ha. Soil water measurements confirmed that this effect was due to the conservation of soil water in the centre of the skip areas for use by the crop after anthesis. A root front velocity of 2 cm/day was observed in all directions from the base of the sorghum plant. Light interception in skip row configurations was shown to be the same as in solid plant configurations between pairs of rows and up to 50 cm into the skip area. Further into the skip area, light interception was effectively nil. These results provide the basis to refine the APSIM Sorghum model to allow simulation of the effect of various row configurations over a range of climatic and soil conditions.},

	abstract = {Physiological traits such as increased kernel number, early flowering, and an increased rate and duration of kernel filling, are thought to increase the potential yield of wheat in certain environments. A crop simulation model (APSIM-NWHEAT) was used to evaluate the role of these traits in improving potential yield under a range of environmental conditions. APSIM-NWHEAT calculates the potential yield for a specific environment limited only by temperature, solar radiation, water and nitrogen supply. The model predicted crop production, soil water and N dynamics for low and high-yielding environments in Australia, The Netherlands and China. Applying the model to the various traits showed that a 20\% increase in kernel number, early anthesis and a 20\% increase in kernel filling rate had no or only minor effects on increasing potential yield in high- and extremely high-yielding environments. In these environments, when a maximum specific kernel size was imposed, a yield increase resulted mainly from a 20\% extension in the duration of kernel filling, suggesting that the crop is usually source limited. In a low-yielding environment, each trait, except early flowering showed a small positive effect on average on increasing potential yield. Early flowering reduced the potential yield on a low water-holding capacity soil. The effect of the various traits on potential yield was also very variable in a low-yielding environment, varying with both seasonal rainfall and soil type, and all traits, except the increased rate of kernel filling, reduced potential yields in some seasons. The effect of the various traits on yield in the low-yielding environment depended on biomass accumulation at anthesis and water availability during kernel filling. When all the traits were simulated together, the relative increase in potential yield was of similar magnitude in both low- and high-yielding environments. The analysis suggested that an increase in the potential yield from 9 to 22\% can be expected from selection for the above physiological traits, but selection in the appropriate environment is important.

Nevertheless, simulation models can compliment traditional field experimentation in researching alternative management options. The first objective of this paper is, therefore, to provide four case study examples of where models were used to help research issues relating to improved nutrient efficiency in low-input cropping systems. The first two cases addressed strategies of augmenting traditional farming practices with small applications of chemical fertilizer (N and P). The latter two cases explicitly addressed the question of what plant genetic traits can be beneficial in low-nutrient farming systems. In each of these case studies, the APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator) systems model was used to simulate the impacts of alternative crop management systems. The question of whether simulation models can assist the research community in contributing to purposeful change in farming practice is also addressed. Recent experiences in Australia are reported where simulation models have contributed to practice change by farmers. Finally, current initiatives aimed at testing whether models can also contribute to improving the nutrient efficiency of smallholder farmers in the SAT are discussed.},

	doi = {10.1016/S0378-4290(02)00044-8},
	abstract = {Partitioning of dry matter (DM) in sugarcane is of interest for two fundamental reasons. Firstly, sugar production depends directly on partitioning of crop biomass to the stalk and then to sucrose stored largely in stalk parenchyma. Secondly, various DM components of the stalk and particularly sucrose concentration are used to calculate the value of cane consignments delivered to the mill. In this study we review data from serial harvesting experiments in South Africa and Australia to discover similarities and differences in DM partitioning of sugarcane grown in a wide range of conditions and to gain a better understanding of the factors influencing DM partitioning as a basis for improving functional responses in sugarcane simulation models. Firstly, climatic and genetic variations in DM partitioning to various above ground plant components of sugarcane and to sucrose within the stalk component, are examined at a broad level. We then assess the robustness of sucrose partitioning rules used in the two international sugarcane models (APSIM and CANEGRO) and provide enhancements on predictions of sucrose content (SC) on a DM basis in sugarcane stalks. Well-adapted cultivars in widely different climatic conditions were similar with respect to partitioning of biomass to various above ground organs. The trash component (dead leaves and dead stalks) was one that varied most between cultivars and growing conditions. The stalk fraction of green biomass (biomass less trash) reached a maximum of about 0.85 when green biomass yield exceeded 60 t ha(-1) regardless of cultivar or extremes of water regime. Opportunities for further improvements of this trait through breeding were not obvious but harvesting could be delayed to ensure that stalk fraction is as high as possible. Variations in SC with respect to age, biomass and seasonal variation in climate, were explained by a simple conceptual model of cane stalk segments which are rapidly filled with sucrose when young and may remobilise sucrose when carbohydrate is required for rapid expansive growth. Season and age effects on whole stalk SC are due to varying proportions of young segments with low SC and older segments with high SC. A mechanistic model capturing these concepts is required but as an interim measure an empirical model based on stalk mass, leaf number per stalk. leaf area index and temperature accounted for a large proportion of the variation in SC across Australian and South African cultivars and conditions. Uses for this model together with CANEGRO or APSIM include improved SC through manipulating irrigation and the harvest schedule and more realistic targets for cane quality.

	abstract = {In this paper we refer to the gene-to-phenotype modeling challenge as the GP problem. Integrating information across levels of organization within a genotype-environment system is a major challenge in computational biology. However, resolving the GP problem is a fundamental requirement if we are to understand and predict phenotypes given knowledge of the genome and model dynamic properties of biological systems. Organisms are consequences of this integration, and it is a major property of biological systems that underlies the responses we observe. We discuss the E(NK) model as a framework for investigation of the GP problem and the prediction of system properties at different levels of organization. We apply this quantitative framework to an investigation of the processes involved in genetic improvement of plants for agriculture. In our analysis, N genes determine the genetic variation for a set of traits that are responsible for plant adaptation to E environment-types within a target population of environments. The N genes can interact in epistatic NK gene-networks through the way that they influence plant growth and development processes within a dynamic crop growth model. We use a sorghum crop growth model, available within the APSIM agricultural production systems simulation model, to integrate the gene-environment interactions that occur during growth and development and to predict genotype-to-phenotype relationships for a given E(NK) model. Directional selection is then applied to the population of genotypes, based on their predicted phenotypes, to simulate the dynamic aspects of genetic improvement by a plant-breeding program. The outcomes of the simulated breeding are evaluated across cycles of selection in terms of the changes in allele frequencies for the N genes and the genotypic and phenotypic values of the populations of genotypes.},

	abstract = {Canola is a relatively new crop in the Mediterranean environment of Western Australia and growers need information on crop management to maximise profitability. However, local information from field experiments is limited to a few seasons and its interpretation is hampered by seasonal rainfall variability. Under these circumstances, a simulation model can be a useful tool. The APSIM-Canola model was tested using data from Western Australian field experiments. These experiments included different locations, cultivars, and sowing dates. Flowering date was predicted by the model with a root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of 4.7 days. The reduction in the period from sowing to flowering with delay in sowing date was accurately reproduced by the model. Observed yields ranged from 0.1 to 3.2 t/ha and simulated yields from 0.4 to 3.0 t/ha. Yields were predicted with a RMSD of 0.3-0.4 t/ha. The yield reduction with delayed sowing date in the high, medium, and low rainfall region (3.2, 6.1, and 8.6\% per week, respectively) was accurately simulated by the model (1.1, 6.7, and 10.3\% per week, respectively). It is concluded that the APSIM-Canola model, together with long-term weather data, can be reliably used to quantify yield expectation for different cultivars, sowing dates, and locations in the grainbelt of Western Australia.},

	abstract = {This overview paper presents a description of the National Windbreaks Program (NWP) - its objectives, the main methods used to achieve these objectives and a summary of the key results. It draws these from the individual papers appearing in this special issue, which provide detailed descriptions and discussion about the specific research sites and research methods used, in addition to interpreting and discussing the results. The key findings were the following: (i) Two broad areas of crop and pasture response can be identified downwind of a porous windbreak: a zone of reduced yield associated with competition with the windbreak trees that extended from 1 H to 3 H, where H is the windbreak height, and a zone of unchanged or slightly increased yield stretching downwind to 10 H or 20 H. (ii) Averaged over the paddock, yield gains due to the effect of shelter on microclimate were smaller than expected - especially for cereals. Yield simulations conducted using the APSIM model and 20 years of historical climate data confirmed this result for longer periods and for other crop growing regions in Australia. Larger yield gains were simulated at locations where the latter part of the growing season was characterised by high atmospheric demand and a depleted soil water store. (iii) Economic analyses that account for the costs of establishing windbreaks, losses due to competition and yield gains as a result of shelter found that windbreaks will either lead to a small financial gain or be cost neutral. (iv) Part of the reason for the relatively small changes in yield measured at the field sites was the variable wind climate which meant that the crop was only sheltered for a small proportion of the growing season. In much of southern Australia, where the day-to-day and seasonal variability in wind direction is large, additional windbreaks planted around the paddock perimeter or as closely-spaced rows within the paddock will be needed to provide more consistent levels of shelter. (v) Protection from infrequent, high magnitude wind events that cause plant damage and soil erosion was observed to lead to the largest yield gains. The main forms of direct damage were sandblasting, which either buries or removes seedlings from the soil or damages the leaves and stems, and direct leaf tearing and stripping. (vi) A corollary to these findings is the differing effect that porous windbreaks have on the air temperature and humidity compared to wind. While winds are reduced in strength in a zone that extends from 5 H upwind to at least 25 H downwind of the windbreak, the effects of shelter on temperature and humidity are smaller and restricted mainly to the quiet zone. This means that fewer windbreaks are required to achieve reductions in wind damage than for altering the microclimate. (vii) The wind tunnel experiments illustrate the important aspects of windbreak structure that determine the airflow downwind, and subsequent microclimate changes, in winds oriented both perpendicular and obliquely to porous windbreaks. These results enable a series of guidelines to be forwarded for designing windbreaks for Australian agricultural systems.},

	volume = {42},
	doi = {10.1071/EA02006},
	abstract = {This paper presents the modelling framework and parameterisations adopted to enable the effects of wind shelter on crop microclimates and growth to be simulated. Two modelling components were required: the first, SCAM (Soil Canopy Atmosphere Model), is a biophysical land surface model used to simulate the effects of shelter on the plant canopy and soil energy and water exchanges. The second is the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) configured for crop modelling (Carberry et al. 2002). This paper describes the link between the two and the parameterisations developed to simulate the effects of shelter and provide potential evaporation estimates for input to APSIM. A series of sensitivity analyses using SCAM demonstrate, as expected, that over the course of the growing season and during meteorological conditions typical of agricultural regions in south-eastern Australia, plant evaporation is relatively insensitive to wind speed. This is consistent with theory and illustrates that reducing wind speeds will only reduce evaporation fluxes when the (unsheltered) canopy evaporation rate exceeds the equilibrium evaporation rate. In other words, reductions in water loss as a result of shelter will arise from one or a combination of the following: (i) reduced soil evaporation following rainfall; (ii) reduced evaporation of rainfall intercepted by the plant canopy; and (iii) reduced plant transpiration during wet periods and/or periods of very high demand when transpiration exceeds the equilibrium evaporation rate. Increased storage of soil moisture as a result of shelter early in the season may sustain crop transpiration later in the growing season. While this may not modify seasonal water use, increased soil water availability for the growing crop may confer an advantage in terms of final yield. The paper then describes the development and validation of a bulk scalar transfer coefficient, or resistance, based on wind tunnel experiments investigating scalar (heat and water vapour) transport in windbreak flows. This coefficient is used in SCAM to parameterise the effect of shelter on the exchanges of heat and water between the atmosphere and the soil and/or plant canopy. A simple parameterisation for this coefficient is developed and implemented. The potential effects of shelter on evaporative demand and hence plant growth are then quantified by using the predictions of plant potential evaporation, calculated from a modified version of SCAM as input to APSIM. The simulations show that events where reduced evaporative demand benefits plant growth can occur intermittently in the latter part of the growing season (i.e. post-anthesis for cereals) for some climatic regimes, as illustrated by the simulations for the Roseworthy, Esperance and Atherton sites used in the National Windbreaks Program.},

	volume = {42},
	doi = {10.1071/EA02020},
	abstract = {Recent reports in Australia and elsewhere have attributed enhanced crop yields to the presence of tree windbreaks on farms. One hypothesis for this observation is that, by reducing wind speed, windbreaks influence crop water and energy balances resulting in lower evaporative demand and increased yield. This paper is the second in a series aimed at developing and using crop and micrometeorological modelling capabilities to explore this hypothesis. Specifically, the objectives of this paper are to assist the interpretation of recent field experimentation on windbreak impacts and to quantify the potential benefits and the likelihood of windbreak effects on crop production through an economic analysis of crop yields predicted for the historical climate record at selected sites in Australia. The APSIM systems model was specified to simulate crop growth under the environmental changes induced by windbreaks and subsequently used to simulate the potential benefits on crop production at 2 actual windbreak sites and 17 hypothetical sites around Australia. With the actual windbreak sites, APSIM closely simulated measured crop growth and yield in open-field conditions. However, neither site demonstrated measurable windbreak impacts and APSIM simulations confirmed that such effects would have been either non-existent or masked by experimental variability in the years under study. For each year of the long-term climate record at 17 sites, APSIM simulated yields of relevant crops for transects behind hypothetical windbreaks that provided protection against all wind. When wind protection from all directions is assumed, average simulated yield increases at 5 H (height of windbreak) ranged from 0.2\% for maize at Atherton to 24.6\% for wheat grown at Dalby, resulting in gross margin changes of -\$14.79/ha. crop and \$24.13/ha. crop, respectively, for a 10 m high windbreak and 100 ha paddock and assuming a 20\% yield loss due to tree competition in the 1.0-3.5 H section. Averaged across all sites and crops, the simulations predicted a yield advantage of 8.6\% at 5 H for protection from wind in any direction, resulting in an average gross margin loss of -\$0.60/ha. crop. At the 8 sites with available data for wind direction, and assuming protection only from wind originating within a 90degrees arc perpendicular to a hypothetical windbreak which was optimally orientated at each site, average simulated yield increases at 5 H ranged from 1.0\% for wheat at Orange to 8.6\% for wheat grown at Geraldton. For a 10 m high windbreak, 100 ha paddock and an assumed 20\% yield loss in the 1.0-3.5 H section, the average result across all sites and crops was a 4.7\% yield advantage at 5 H and an average gross margin loss of -\$2.49/ha. crop. In conclusion, APSIM simulation and economic analyses indicated that yield benefits from microclimate changes can at least partly offset the opportunity costs of positioning tree windbreaks on farms.},

	abstract = {APSIM-Nwheat is a wheat crop system simulation model within the APSIM framework which consists of modules that incorporate aspects of soil water, nitrogen, residues, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop development and growth, including grain protein content. APSIM-Nwheat has been validated for soil water, soil N, crop phenology, biomass production and yield. However, previous analyses have indicated that model performance was poor in terms of grain protein simulations particularly under very high or very low N input conditions together with terminal drought. The original routine for grain protein content simulated grain protein as a function of independent dry matter and N accumulation into the grain. To constrain grain protein content simulations under very high and very low N input conditions, without effecting other simulations, a simple but physiologically sound link was incorporated between dry matter and N translocation to the grain. An upper boundary of daily protein transfer to the grain was set to 4\% N (22.8 \% grain protein), and a lower boundary was set at 1.23\% N (7\% grain protein). In addition, grain N was initialised with up to 3\% N (17.1\% grain protein) at the beginning of the grain filling phase, depending on the availability of tissue N. The new modified grain protein routine was tested across field data sets from a wide range of growing conditions and slowed an improved performance with a RMSD, consistent across environments and soil types, at or below 0.35\% N (2\% grain protein). Independent tests, including data from different climates and a sensitivity analysis confirmed the improved simulation of grain protein under a wide range of conditions. The improved model was found to be reliable and robust enough to be used for specific simulation experiments to study grain protein interactions with management, soil types and environments in different climatic regions.

On average, maize growth and development in response to N was simulated with a degree of accuracy that justified its use in analysis of risk associated with N use in these semi-arid regions of Zimbabwe. APSIM was then configured to simulate the response to N over a 46-year climate record in order to assess the long-term risks associated with N use. The simulated long-term distribution indicated that negative responses to N could be expected in 15\% of years, whereas no negative response to N was recorded in the experiments at the Makoholi Research Centre. Median responses were 20 30 kg maize grain kg(-1) N for observed arid simulated results. In terms of return oil fertilizer investment, the observed arid simulated distributions were also similar: in about 20\% of scars, a negative return could be expected, while in the best 20\% of years a return of \$Z5000 or more could be expected given the grain: fertilizer price ratio which, at March 2000, was about 1:7. The model analysis has suggested moderate rates (approximately 30 kg N ha(-1)) of N fertilizer would give greater responses per unit N applied than smaller rates (15 kg N ha(-1)). There was no evidence that conditional fertilizer strategies based on early-season rainfall would offer significant benefits over fixed application strategies. Early sowing at recommended population densities gave higher responses to N than were achieved for late sown or low-density crops.},

	abstract = {The water balances of several annual crops grown in rotation with lucerne were monitored and compared with that under a native white-cypress forest near Wagga Wagga, New South Wales. Water use by the white cypress forest was slightly greater than that by canola, but much less than by cereals and lucerne during the growing season. The cereal and canola crops have a cyclic water use pattern (high in spring, low in summer/autumn) while that for the white cypress is more uniform through the year. Lucerne behaves more like the cypress forest. It uses water throughout the year, and is a high water use alternative to be grown in rotation with crops. It extracts water below the 'nominal' rooting depth of annual crops that has built up from several years of cropping. This reduces the likelihood of deep drainage in the subsequent winter by creating a buffer for water storage. Simulations using APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator) run on historical weather data (1957 to 1997) confirmed the potential of lucerne to keep the soil drier and reduce drainage in a rotation. Soil water storage gradually increased under wheat after the lucerne was removed, and was similar to that under continuous wheat after 2 to 3 years. The refilling of the buffer depends on the timing and amount of rainfall. In general, this means that the wheat phase should probably not exceed 2 to 3 years. Furthermore, the drying under lucerne happens rapidly and often within the first summer/autumn of the lucerne phase, with little difference in water use between lucerne and wheat during winter/spring. These results suggest that practical benefits can be obtained by growing lucerne for as little as 12 months, yet, at other times, it may need to be grown for 2 or even 3 years.},

ETc is obtained using the CANEGRO and APSIM simulation models. The former is used extensively to schedule irrigation while the latter uses a transpiration use efficiency concept to estimate ETc from the increment in aboveground biomass and vapour pressure deficit. Determination of Kc (crop coefficient) is obtained from measured ETc divided by ET 0. The relationship between the daily ET 0 and daily ET c measured when the canopy was closed in Australia was similar to the relationship between those measured in Swaziland. Results showed that the APSIM-Sugarcane and CANEGRO simulation models were able to stimulate ETc with an acceptable degree of accuracy. The results obtained from this collaborative project support the Kc initial (0.4) and the Kc mid (1.25) value for sugarcane. However, there was no evidence to support a reduction in Kc during the final stage of development. The similarity between Kc mid determined in Australia and Swaziland indicated that crop coefficients derived from these experiments were sufficiently robust to be used across contrasting environments and cultivars.},

Utilising upon thc se constructs, we review six types of farming systems analysis and intervention that have evolved over the last 40 years, namely: (1) economic decision analysis based on production functions, (2) dynamic simulation of production processes, (3) economic decision analysis linked to biophysical simulation, (4) decision support systems, (5) expert systems, and (6) simulation-aided discussions about management in an action research paradigm. Biophysical simulation modelling features prominently in this list of approaches and considerable progress has been made in both the scope and predictive power of the modelling tools. We illustrate some more recent advances in increasing model comprehensiveness in simulating farm production systems via reference to our own group's work with the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM). Two case studies are discussed, one with broad-scale commercial agriculture in north-eastern Australia and the other with resource poor smallholder farmers in Africa. We conclude by considering future directions for systems analysis efforts directed at farming systems. We see the major challenges and opportunities lying at the interface of 'hard', scientific approaches to the analysis of biophysical systems and 'soft', approaches to intervention in social management systems.

	doi = {10.1023/A:1010381602223},
	abstract = {Water-use efficiency (WUE [g grain yield m(-2) mm(-1) ET]) and nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE [Delta g grain yield g(-1) N applied]) are important measures that can affect the productivity of crops in different environmental systems. However, measurement and interpretation of WUE and NUE in the field are often hampered by the high degree of complexity of these systems due to season-to-season variability in rainfall, the variation in crop responses to soil types and to agronomic management. To be able to guide agronomic practice, experimentally-derived measurements of WUE and NUE need to be extrapolated across time and space through appropriate modelling. To illustrate this approach, the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM), which has been rigorously tested for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in a Mediterranean environment, was used to estimate and analyse the WUE and NUE of wheat crops in the Mediterranean-climatic region of the central Western Australian agricultural zone. The APSIM model was run for three locations (average annual rainfall of 461 mm [high rainfall zone], 386 mm [medium] and 310 mm [low]) and two soil types that had contrasting plant-available water-holding capacities in the rooting zone (sand: 55 mm, clay soil: 109 mm). Simulations were carried out with historical weather records (82-87 years) assuming current crop management and cultivars. The modelling analyses highlighted the inherently high degree of seasonal variability in yield, WUE and NUE of wheat, depending on soil type, N fertiliser input, rainfall amount and, in particular, rainfall distribution. The clay soil tended to be more productive in terms of grain yield, WUE and NUE in the high and medium rainfall zones, but less productive in most years in the low rainfall zone. The sandy soil was less productive in the high rainfall zone due to the high nitrate leaching potential of this soil type, but more productive than the clay in the low rainfall zone due to poorer pre-anthesis growth and less water use, less water loss by soil evaporation and relatively more water use in the post-anthesis phase. When a wheat crop was sown early on clay soil in the low rainfall zone, it yielded as high as in the other rainfall zones in seasons when rainfall was above average or there was a good store of water in the soil prior to sowing. The simulations confirmed findings from a limited number of field experiments and extended these findings both qualitatively and quantitatively across soil types, rainfall regions and crop management options. Furthermore, by using long-term historical weather records, the simulations extended the findings across the wide range of climatic scenarios experienced in mediterranean-climatic regions.},

	abstract = {The failure of model-based decision support systems to impact on management of the agri-food value chain provides the background to an ongoing ten-year-old participatory action research (PAR) program. This program investigated an alternate paradigm in which a cropping systems simulator, APSIM, was used in discussions with managers to construct new understandings and new management options in practice. The research commenced in 1992 with a pilot project to investigate the possibility of simulation having an impact on farm managers' capacity to cope with a risky production environment. Researchers added value to farmers' practical trials through monitoring of daily weather, soil water and soil nitrogen resources. Simulation was used to extend the application of the trials to other years and other management options. Reflection on the impacts of the project led to a scaled up effort to develop networks of farmer groups facilitated by agronomy consultants to engage in on-farm monitoring and use simulation to aid discussions on a wide range of management possibilities in what became the FARMSCAPE (Farmers, Advisers, Researchers, Monitoring, Simulation, Communication And Performance Evaluation) approach. With evidence of significant impacts on farm management, and a growing demand for a sustainable delivery system for APSIM simulations, we turned our attention to a FARMSCAPE training and accreditation program to enable agronomic consulting companies to offer their own FARMSCAPE services in a commercial environment. A parallel development, which emerged from reflection on an earlier "in-business" study, was an investigation of the feasibility of APSIM having a useful role off farm in other sections of the agri-food value chain. Case studies in portfolio management, financial assessment, and crop insurance and crop loss assessment helped us understand what it takes to invent a role for APSIM in these sectors. We share our wider vision for future applications; our observations on the efficacy of PAR methodology in this program; and suggest institutional changes to encourage the engagement of scientists and their models with practice.},

Simulation models can provide the appropriate means to extrapolate across time and space. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) was used to analyse deep drainage under wheat crops in the Mediterranean climate of the central Western Australian wheatbelt. In addition to rigorous model testing elsewhere, comparisons between simulated and observed soil water loss, evapotranspiration, and deep drainage for different soil types and seasons confirmed the reasonable performance of the APSIM model. The APSIM model was run with historical weather records (70-90 years) across 2 transects from the coast (high rainfall zone) to the eastern edge of the wheatbelt (low rainfall zone). Soils were classified as 5 major types: deep sand, deep loamy sand, acid loamy sand, shallow duplex (waterlogging), and clay soil (non-waterlogging). Simulations were carried out on these soil types with historical weather records, assuming current crop management and cultivars. Soil water profiles were reset each year to the lower limit of plant-available water, assuming maximum water use in the previous crop. Results stressed the high degree of seasonal variability of deep drainage ranging from 0 to 386 mm at Moora in the high rainfall region (461 mm/year average rainfall), from 0 to 296 mm at Wongan Hills in the medium rainfall region (386 mm/year average rainfall), and from 0 to 234 mm at Merredin in the low rainfall region (310 mm/year average rainfall). The largest amounts of drainage occurred in soils with lowest extractable water-holding capacities. Estimates of annual drainage varied with soil type and location. For example, average (s.d.) annual drainage at Moora, Wongan Hills, and Merredin was 134 (73), 90 (61), and 36 (43) mm on a sand, and 57 (64),},

Strategies are being sought to increase water use in cropping systems and to reduce deep drainage. Quantifying potential drainage through measurements is hampered by the high degree of complexity of these systems as a result of diverse soil types, a range of crops, and in particular the inherent seasonal variability. Simulation models can provide the appropriate means to extrapolate across time and space. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) was used to explore the effect of alternative agronomic practices on wheat production and deep drainage for representative soils and rainfall regions of the central wheatbelt of Western Australia. Soil water profiles were reset each year to the lower limit of plant-available water, assuming maximum water use in the previous crop. The long-term simulation studies showed that management practices with N fertiliser directed at yield increase were most effective in achieving these aims in the medium to high rainfall regions. The corresponding effect for drainage reduction was marginal. The small effect on drainage control associated with production increase can be traced to the effect of rainfall distribution with major occurrences of both rainfall and drainage during winter (June-August) coinciding with the lowest potential atmospheric demand for evapotranspiration, in combination with low water-holding capacity soils. Nitrogen-induced increases in crop transpiration were in conjunction with reduced soil evaporation, which increased water use efficiency and occurred mostly after the main drainage period, but had little effect on deep drainage within the season. Similar outcomes of enhanced productivity with minor impact on deep drainage were noted with crops sown at different times and with a hypothetical wheat crop having a deeper rooting system. Simulations without resetting soil water each year enabled the quantification of potential carryover effects on long-term average deep drainage. The carry-over of soil water left behind at crop harvest reduced the water storage capacity of the soil in a subsequent year and could increase long-term deep drainage substantially, depending on soil type. Improved management increased late water use in the high rainfall region, in particular on better water-holding soils, and could largely reduce this carry-over effect. The current wheat-based cropping systems, even with alternative management practices, continue to be a major threat to sustainability on the low water-holding soils in the wheatbelt of Western Australia, as a main cause of secondary salinity.},

	abstract = {The nitrogen fixed by legumes is a valuable resource in agriculture, with crop legumes alone contributing as much as 20\% of the nitrogen requirements of the world's grain and oilseed crops. Increasing legume nitrogen fixation through genetic improvement and more efficient management would have large economic benefits. Breeding for improved nitrogen fixation has, to a large extent, not been successful. Suggested reasons include the difficulty in combining single traits like nitrogen fixation with other traits, such as disease resistance, seed quality and yield, a lack of focus of programs and a lack of screening methodologies. Agronomic management of legume nitrogen fixation offers other opportunities. The challenge is to package those opportunities and provide legume growers with tools for understanding the factors determining nitrogen fixation, while at the same time providing them with site-specific management options. The potential of simulation modelling for assessing genetic and management options for enhancing nitrogen fixation of soybean grown at Warwick in south-eastern Queensland was investigated in a series of 30-year simulations using the APSIM modelling framework. The APSIM-soybean module was first adjusted to reflect observed responses of nitrogen fixation to soil nitrate. The subsequent simulations indicated that (genetically based) symbiotic nitrate tolerance would have only marginal benefits on residual soil nitrate (7 kg N/ha at sowing soil nitrate of 100 kg N/ha). Management of the crop for highest grain yield through optimising sowing dates, plant density and fallow length provided the best opportunities for increasing nitrogen fixation. The use of APSIM as a tool for managing legume nitrogen fixation appears to have merit.},

	abstract = {Trash blankets contain substantial amounts of nitrogen (N) and other nutrients. The availability of N in trash is complicated because most of the N cycles through the soil organic matter. To gain insights into the long-term fate of N contained in trash, N balances were analysed in two trash management experiments, in Australia and South Africa. Long-term N balances were simulated with the APSIM-Sugarcane cropping systems model that was verified against cane yields and soil C data measured in the experiments. In a 35 years simulation of the Australian experiment, the model suggests that 86\% of the N in the trash blanket, which otherwise would have been lost by burning trash, was either 'stored' in the soil organic matter or exported from the site in harvested cane. In simulations of the South African experiment, trash blanketing reduced the rate of organic matter depletion and maintained N exported in cane at levels similar to that in the burnt treatments, which had higher inputs of N from fertiliser. The study illustrates the positive effect of long-term trash blanketing on N cycling (particularly soil organic N) in sugarcane systems and the pivotal role cropping systems modelling can play in assessing the fate of N originating from trash blankets in response to different soils, climates and managements.},

	abstract = {The historical context, recent trends, and possible future role of forages in cropping systems are reviewed. Three recent themes will be developed: 1) The successful exploitation of genetic diversity resulting in commercial development of new legume species as pasture cultivars with specific traits better suited to the needs of current farming systems. 2) Improved understanding of key soil processes under grazed pastures, particularly soil water and soil nitrogen, and how these processes impact on indicators of sustainability like deep drainage and nitrate leaching. 3) An emerging capacity for predicting the effect of pasture-crop sequences on soil processes, crop growth and grain yield. In response to changing economic pressures and threats to sustainability, new farming systems involving forages are continually evolving. Increasing cropping intensity has placed pressure on pasture-crop systems that rely on self-regeneration of annual legumes following crops. One response has been the emergence of phase cropping systems, where a sequence of pasture years is followed by a sequence of cropping years. Another response has been an expansion in the area of lucerne grown in rotation with crops. In the future, forages in cropping systems will continue to fulfil the traditional roles of diversifying farm income through livestock production and supporting the cropping enterprise through maintenance of soil fertility. But increasingly, forages will be utilised to maintain the sustainability of agricultural production systems.. Examples include competitive forages as a component of integrated weed management and high water use forages for reducing recharge and the associated spread of dryland salinity.},

There is widespread interest in exploring alternative management strategies and alternative farming systems that can make better use of rainfall, restrict deep drainage and limit salinization. While the problem occurs at broad landscape scales, the primary cause is farming practice at the farm or field scale. Farming systems models, appropriately specified at the field scale, have an important role to play in exploring the impact of alternative crops, pastures and management practices on the deep drainage term of the water balance. This paper reports on 2 applications of APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator) model to explore the interactions between farming systems design, management, soil and climate factors. In the first example, a transect approach is used to analyse the interactions between farming system design and climate in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), which is one of Australia's major drainage systems in which agricultural land, water ways and natural environments are at risk from salinity. The second example reports on the FARMSCAPE approach, which combines on-farm monitoring with APSIM simulation-aided discussions about farm management possibilities, including economic and environmental trade-offs, among groups of farmers, advisers, and researchers in an action research setting. Both examples highlight the existence of a significant challenge to identify 'win-win' farming systems that compare favourably to existing systems in terms of both profitability and drainage criteria.},

	abstract = {Models of agro-ecosystems provide means of prediction beyond the bounds of experience or experimentation. Extrapolation may involve simulation of the expected behaviour for different climate and/or soil conditions, perhaps with alternative management, or for a longer time scale than observed experimentally. The issues to be addressed include those concerned with crop growth and profitability, effects on the soil resource, and consequences for the environment. The extent to which the model output is credible depends on how well the model represents those aspects of the system that an important for a particular application. In principle, any model can be enhanced to deal with additional factors, but more complex models become increasingly hungry for inputs, and increasingly difficult to test against actual data. There are judgements to be made as to whether the demands of model building/testing can be justified. The choice of what soil constraints should be included in models will depend on what the model is to be used for and the understanding of the processes that the model purports to represent. The dynamics of water and nitrogen are the soil features commonly represented in crop/forest models. Based particularly on experiences with the APSIM modelling framework, the paper reports developments aimed at dealing with erosion, soil structure, salinisation, acidification, and phosphorus as Limitations to plant growth. Modelling the consequences of global change on crops and forests involves issues of productivity, climatic variability, "greenhouse" effects and sustainability. Discussion focuses on whether current models need to be enhanced by including other constraints in order to address such issues. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

A brief history and description of each model is presented with an examination of their performance and a suggested way forward to improve their accuracy and utility. The models examined were the Australian APSIM-Sugarcane model, the South African CANEGRO model and another Australian model; QCANE. Despite limited published performance data, all the models have performed reasonably well, but the prediction of sucrose yields were not the same. Mean errors of prediction (root mean square of residuals) for sucrose yield for APSIM-Sugarcane were 4.12 Mg ha-1, for CANEGRO 6.07 Mg ha-1 and for QCANE 2.51 Mg ha-1. Improvements for each of the models lie in better understanding (1) the effects of stress (water, nitrogen and temperature) on the partitioning of photosynthate to stored sucrose, (2) the response of different cultivars to stress, and (3) the differences between plant and ratoon crops in respect of radiation-use efficiency and transpiration efficiency. A new approach employing a source-sink concept is suggested, but includes the volume of stalks as a state variable to define the sink size. A central feature is to include a new state variable; reducing sugars to allow the hydrolysis and re-synthesis of sucrose for the construction of the structural stalk carbon (fibre) and to supply stalk maintenance carbon (CO2). Such an approach should offer more mechanistic and explanatory investigations into the growth and management of sugarcane with respect to its sucrose yield and purity, particularly in respect of various ripening strategies.},

	abstract = {This paper demonstrates the capability of the model, APSIM-Sugarcane to analyse system performance, by consideration of crop production and related issues for two contrasting sugarcane production systems in northern Australia. Daily output data from short-term model runs are used to demonstrate the capability of the model to represent the diverse management of sugarcane crops encountered in Australia. Output from longer term simulations is used to investigate a number of 'real life' sustainability issues, including an assessment of the production risk associated with season to season climate variability at each site, and the long-term implications of crop residue management on system performance. The paper also develops guidelines for methodological issues in long-term simulations of sugarcane production systems, relating to (1) the length of the climate record necessary to capture the 'true' season to season variability, (2) the need or otherwise to simulate each crop class (i.e. plant and ratoon crops) over the full climate record, and (3) the impact of initial soil conditions on the time for the system to reach a state ol: equilibrium. Results from statistical tears comparing pairs of distributions for various simulation run lengths, identified significant differences for run lengths up to 40 years. This suggests that, while adequate for most scenarios, the current practice of basing sugarcane simulations on 40 years' climate data will not always capture the true season to season variability in response to climate. Results showed that variability associated with season to season climate by management interactions can be adequately captured in a single model run comprised of consecutive crop cycles, without the need to represent every crop class in every year. These findings have the potential to significantly improve modelling efficiency by reducing model run times, simplifying the analysis of model output and, reducing the required computer storage space. Results from long-term simulations, for some model output variables, indicate there is likely to be an initial period of 'settling in' of between 5 and 10 years as the model approaches a state of equilibrium, during which the response of certain model variables will be 'abnormal' and should be used with caution or discarded.

	volume = {66},
	doi = {10.1016/S0378-4290(00)00069-1},
	abstract = {The Mauritian sugar cane (Saccharum spp.) industry is characterised by high climatic variability both from year-to-year and across agro-climatic zones. There is a need to assess yield variation with a view to facilitate crop management as well as investment decision-making, such as irrigation schemes. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of using crop simulation modelling to quantify potential and attainable yield at contrasting sites. Potential yield is that limited by temperature, radiation, for a given cultivar and season length, while attainable yield has the additional constraint of water supply (rainfall and irrigation where it is applied). The sugar cane module of the Agricultural Productions Systems Simulator (APSIM-Sugar cane) had not been previously used under Mauritian conditions. Hence, the first step is to validate the model using data from growth analysis experiments with plant and ratoon crops of three contrasting commercial cultivar (R 570, M 13/56 and M 555/60), harvested at two dates (July and October) at two sites. The validation step showed that only a limited number of crop coefficients needed adjustment: those concerning canopy expansion, biomass partitioning and crop development. Linear fit of simulated and observed data were close to the 1:1 line and coefficients of determination were highly significant for LAI (r(2)=0.66), above-ground biomass (r(2)=0.84), dry weight of cane (r(2)=0.73) and sucrose yield (r(2)=0.78). There was some indication that model modification for the effects of water stress and flowering on canopy development and biomass accumulation would improve the simulations. The model was used to assess the variability in potential and attainable yield at three sites (Pamplemousses, Medine and Reduit) using long-term climate data for the period 1961-1995, Simulations were conducted for rainfed and fully irrigated scenarios. The three sites contrasted in annual rainfall, solar radiation and mean temperature and hence in expected potential and attainable yield. The range in model-simulated yields of cultivar R 570 were close to the range of experimentally observed yields at the selected sites under rainfed and fully irrigated conditions. Simulated yields were more variable under rainfed than irrigated production, with variability increasing across sites as mean annual rainfall decreased.

At all sites, irrigated yields across the climatic record were highly positively correlated with mean daily solar radiation.

	title = {The potential value of seasonal climate forecasting in managing cropping systems},
	volume = {21},
	abstract = {There is considerable interest in exploring the value of seasonal climate forecasts in assisting farmers to manage cropping systems, not only for short-term decisions on crop management but also for longer-term strategic decisions on crop rotations. This paper reviews a range of applications for climate forecasts, but focuses on cropping systems issues that would benefit from long lead-time forecasts. A specific case study is used to demonstrate the potential for using the Southern Oscillation Index in assisting the incorporation of opportunity cropping into dryland cotton production systems. In the case study, the standard dryland cropping rotation of long fallowing from sorghum (through a subsequent summer fallow) to cotton is compared to alternative fixed rotations and to a rotation influenced by an SOI forecast. The decision point is the October after sorghum harvest where the manager can choose to proceed with the standard slimmer fallow or plant sorghum or cotton in that season with the intention in all cases of planting cotton in the following summer. These three fixed rotations (fallow-cotton, sorghum-cotton, cotton-cotton) are compared to an SOI-influenced strategy using a simulation analysis over the long-term climate record for Dalby, Qld. The simulation case study demonstrated that SOI contributed some skill to improving management decisions over a two-year rotation. By changing between fallow-cotton, sorghum-cotton or cotton-cotton rotations based on the SOI phase in the August-September period preceding the next two summers, average gross margins for the two year period increased by 14\% over a standard fallow-cotton rotation. At the same time, soil loss from erosion was reduced by 23\% and cash flow was improved in many years because an extra crop was sown. The SOI-based strategy did however increase the risk of economic loss from 5\% of years for the standard fallow-cotton rotation to 9\%, but this risk was considerably less than the 15\% for sorghum-cotton and 19\% for cotton-cotton rotations. In conclusion, there are many decisions in the management of dryland cropping systems that would greatly benefit from climate forecasts with persistence in skill out to two years in duration. The case study used in this paper demonstrated some skill in using the SOI in choosing a cropping rotation of two-year duration. Such applications are the obvious next frontier both for the development of enhanced forecasting schemes and for their application within the cropping systems of northern Australia and possibly elsewhere.},

	abstract = {In the northern Australian cropping region, mungbean is commonly sown as an opportunity crop, usually on low soil water after a winter cereal, and consequently has a reputation for being a low yielding, high risk crop. Yield prospects could be improved and risks reduced if it was sown on soils with a higher soil water content, for instance in spring after a winter fallow. However, there is a lack of experience and confidence in alternative roles for mungbean in the farming system. This paper describes a research approach involving researchers, farmers, advisers, and grain traders in which on-farm monitoring of spring-sown commercial crops and cropping systems simulation with APSIM were used to explore yield prospects for a spring-sown crop after a winter fallow. The key elements of the approach are: (1) identification of possible options through simulation of scenarios, (2) testing the new practice with innovative farmers, and (3) monitoring of the management and performance of commercial crops and comparing yields with benchmarks estimated with a model. In this case, after 2 years of on-farm testing, spring-sown mungbean has been shown to have a potential for high returns in the northern cropping systems.},

Studies assessing the production potential and optimum crop management of hemp could benefit from the use of a simulation model that captures crop growth and development processes in response to management, genotypic, soil and climate factors. Such a model would complement the more traditional agronomic field trial programs by helping to identify the need, extent and nature of such trials, and by extrapolating limited field results across both temporal and spatial dimensions. The hemp model described in the final paper in this series, divides crop phenology into 5 phases, the first of which includes the pre-emergent processes of germination and the subsequent elongation of hypocotyl and radicle. This first paper reports on a study into the response of these pre-emergent processes to temperature. The primary objectives were to establish a simple model for predicting the duration from sowing to emergence and to obtain estimates for the cardinal temperatures of hemp growth and development. Cardinal temperatures are required for the estimation of thermal time, which drives phenological development and canopy expansion in the hemp model.

	abstract = {In studies assessing the prospects for a hemp industry, as well as in longer term research activities, the use of a hemp simulation model to complement the more traditional agronomic field trials would offer a number of potential advantages. In addition to being cost and labour intensive, field trials with hemp have political, social and security implications. With these implications in mind, a simulation model that captures the growth and development processes of hemp in response to management, genotypic, soil and climate factors, has the potential to increase research efficiency. The model could be used to assess the need, extent and nature of field trials, to help interpret field trial results, and to investigate temporal and spatial variability in selected crop responses. This paper describes a hemp crop growth and development model (APSIM-Hemp) and its validation against an independent dataset. The model was developed as a crop module within the framework of the larger systems model, Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM), to extend the capability to encompass the agricultural system in which hemp is grown. APSIM-Hemp incorporates relationships developed in the previous papers in this series relating to pre- and post-emergent phenology and leaf area production. Other parameters relating to biomass partitioning, biomass production, water uptake and nitrogen uptake were derived from separate field studies and selected references. APSIM-Hemp adequately predicted phenology, leaf area and biomass production for the cultivar Kompolti at Forthside in north-western Tasmania, for a dataset comprised of results from trials conducted over 3 seasons and including treatments of sowing date, irrigation regime and plant density. Although performing well against this independent dataset, the performance of the model needs to be further validated over a range of other soil, climate and management conditions in order to assess its broader predictive capability. Notwithstanding these limitations, the sound basis of a model for simulating the growth and development of hemp has been developed.},

	abstract = {APSIM Nwheat is a crop system simulation model, consisting of modules that incorporate aspects of soil water, nitrogen (N), crop residues, and crop growth and development. The model was applied to simulate above- and below-ground growth, grain yield, water and N uptake, and soil water and soil N of wheat crops in the Netherlands. Model outputs were compared with detailed measurements of held experiments from three locations with two different soil types. The experiments covered two seasons and a range of N-fertiliser applications. The overall APSIM Nwheat model simulations of soil mineral N, N uptake, shoot growth, phenology, kernels m(-2), specific grain weight and grain N were acceptable. Grain yields (dry weight) and grain protein concentrations were well simulated with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.8 t ha(-1) and 1.6 protein\%, respectively. Additionally, the model simulations were compared with grain yields from a long-term winter wheat experiment with different N applications, two additional N experiments and regional grain yield records. The model reproduced the general effects of N treatments on yields. Simulations showed a good consistency with the higher yields of the long-term experiment, but overpredicted the lower yields. Simulations and earlier regional yields differed, but they showed uniformity for the last decade. In a simulation experiment, the APSIM Nwheat model was used with historical weather data to study the relationship between rate and timing of N fertiliser and grain yield, grain protein and soil residual N. A median grain yield of 4.5 t ha(-1) was achieved without applying fertiliser, utilising mineral soil N from previous seasons, from mineralisation and N deposition. Application of N fertiliser in February to increase soil mineral N to 140 kg N ha(-1) improved the median yield to 7.8 t ha(-1) but had little effect on grain protein concentration with a range of 8-10\%. Nitrogen applications at tillering and the beginning of stem elongation further increased grain yield and in particular grain protein, but did not affect soil residual N, except in a year with low rainfall during stem elongation. A late N application at flag leaf stage increased grain protein content by several per cent. This increase had only a small effect on grain yield and did not increase soil residual N with up to 40 kg N ha(-1) applied, except when N uptake was limited by low rainfall in the period after the flag leaf stage. The economic and environmental optima in winter wheat were identified with up to 140 kg N ha(-1) in February, 90 kg N ha(-1) between tillering and beginning of stem elongation and 40 kg N ha(-1) at flag leaf stage resulting in a median of 8.5 t ha(-1) grain yield, 14.0\% grain protein and 13 kg N ha(-1) soil residual N after the harvest. The maximum simulated yield with maximum N input from two locations in the Netherlands was 9.9 t ha(-1). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Soil hydraulic processes, particularly those affecting water storage and uptake, play an important role in the efficiency of water use, but their measurement is a major challenge to obtaining reliable estimates of rainfall and water use efficiency. The aims of this paper were (i) to develop a modelling technique to determine maximum rooting depth and total plant extractable water capacity (PAWC) from plant extension measurements; (ii) to use this technique to produce soil hydraulic input parameters for the APSIM-Sugarcane model for a number of soils in the Bundaberg region (Queensland); and (iii) to simulate the impact of soil type on rainfall and water use efficiencies. It was shown that leaf or stalk elongation measurements combined with conventional soil hydraulic measurements and modelling can expedite the characterisation PAWC for determining rainfall and water use efficiencies. Interactions of soil type and yearly climate on these efficiencies were considerable. The prevalence of these interactions detracts from the use of generalisations. PAWC and maximum rooting depth could be determined rapidly from existing soil surveys and stalk growth. This will enhance benchmarking and the establishment of improved management strategies to best use water in sugar industries worldwide.},

This paper aims to demonstrate that local advisory staff could employ the production system model, APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator) to explore a number of irrigation attributes. APSIM was configured to determine effective rainfall, crop irrigation demand, crop response to irrigation and cane water index for different soil types and irrigation allocations in the Proserpine area of Queensland. Crop simulations were conducted for a 40-year period between 1957 and 1997 from composite climate data collected at the Proserpine Post Office and Proserpine Airport. Results demonstrate that effective rainfall varied between 400 mm and 1200 mm depending on year and soil type. Irrigation was also shown to significantly reduce effective rainfall. The average irrigation demand for sugarcane in the Proserpine area was estimated to be between 4 and 6 megalitres (ML)/ha. However, this was sensitive to soil type and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) rainfall regime. Average crop response from the first two megalitres per hectare allocation was 13.5 t/ha, which decreased with each additional 2 ML/ha allocation. Cane Water Index (CWI) benchmarks determined at 100\% irrigation application efficiency varied between years, soil type and allocation. Results demonstrate that APSIM was able to estimate credible values for district average and yearly variation in crop response to irrigation, water use efficiency, irrigation demand and effective rainfall.

	abstract = {irrigation of effluent is an increasingly popular treatment option due to concern about nutrient additions to rivers and coastal waters. Since some studies have shown that irrigation with waste water can lead to contamination of groundwater resources, there is need for a model to predict the fate of irrigated water, salt, and nitrogen that can be applied to a variety of different soils, climates, and crops. We present the development of the water balance part of such a model, APSIM for Effluent, and carry out a comparison against data obtained from an effluent-irrigated plantation of Eucalyptus grandis. Over 10 months, modelled tree water use was within 1.5\% of that obtained by sap-flux measurements. When compared over 5 years of the experiment, modelled drainage lay above that estimated by a water balance technique, which was known a priori to underestimate drainage, and was close to that estimated by the chloride mass balance technique. Simulated chloride accumulated in the soil was within the scatter of the observations, although it was consistently at the lower end of the range of the data. There was good agreement between the model predictions and measured chloride concentration distribution with depth in the soil. A considerable amount of water was lost as deep drainage, even for the treatment that aimed to add only enough effluent to replace that: lost by evaporation. During 5 years, of the 3370 mm rainfall and 4480 mm effluent received by that treatment, 6710 mm was lost by the various evaporative routes, and 1080 mm was lost by deep drainage.

Cyclosporin A impeded the permeability transition and swelling, although complete inhibition was not observed. Cells survived the dissipation of Delta Psi(m) by CCCP for up to 6 h without developing any obvious cell damage or signs of apoptosis. With the restoration of Delta Psi(m) after removal of CCCP (following 6 h of CCCP treatment), permeability transition pores were closed.

	abstract = {Water balance information at locations across southern Australia is analysed to identify mechanistic causes for higher water tables under agricultural systems compared to natural vegetation. Contrasting patterns of water use indicate pronounced physiological activity in summer by natural ecosystems ensuring the persistence of the dominant perennial species. A strategy of tempered water use during periods of rainfall excess in winter/spring enables seasonal carryover of soil water to be withdrawn by deep roots for summer functioning. Characteristic patterns of water use by agricultural systems, comprised mainly of determinant annual species, are truncated in time but feature elevated peak rates coinciding with periods of maximum soil water availability during the cooler months. Low seasonal vapour pressure deficit explains the observed benefits of enhanced biomass production due to high water use efficiency. The associated limited scope for soil water uptake carries the penalty of increased frequency of drainage and the subsequent resource degradation currently associated with farmland. Inclusion of a perennial lucerne phase in rotation with crops confers environmental benefit through summer uptake from a rooting depth double that of crops. An effective buffer is thus provided to restrict drainage under an ensuing cropping phase in a manner that more closely emulates natural systems. Simulations of phase farming point to a halving in long term drainage. They suggest adoption over a range of arable land units could cause local retreat of water tables by 0.3 m y(-1) initially, leading to a new equilibrium level which would still remain elevated with respect to that under natural vegetation.},

Knowledge of nitrogen transformations and balances is essential to design and operate plantations so as to keep groundwater degradation within acceptable limits. APSIM for Effluent, a model of water, salt, and nitrogen in effluent-irrigated plantations was tested against data from a plantation of Eucalyptus grandis (flooded gum) irrigated with either secondary-treated sewage effluent or bore water. APSIM was then used for quantifying nitrogen transformations, leaching, and balance, within the plantation. Summed over 5 years, the predicted nitrogen balance of the effluent-irrigated treatment showed that the accumulation of nitrogen in the aboveground biomass and litter (335 and 19 kg/ha) was significantly less than the amount of nitrogen added in effluent (508 kg/ha). Denitrification at this site was low, about 52 kg/ha over 5 years, because the soil was permeable and unlikely to become anaerobic for substantial periods of time. After 5 years, organic nitrogen decreased by 167 kg N/ha, and 269 kg N/ha was leached. In the trees irrigated with bore water, accumulation of nitrogen in the biomass and litter (301 and 34 kg/ha) was not much less than for the effluent-irrigated treatment and was considerably greater than the nitrogen added in the bore water irrigation (14 kg/ha). After 5 years, the predicted fluxes were 10 kg/ha denitrified, 389 kg/ha depleted from soil organic matter, and about 58 kg/ha leached. About 75\% of the nitrogen leaching occurred in the first year of the experiment.},

	title = {Advances in the science and economics of supplementary irrigation of sugarcane.},
	abstract = {Irrigation science in recent years has been driven largely by the technology requirements of large schemes where production would be impossible without irrigation. In these schemes, the aim is often to remove water as a constraint to production, whereas in many sugar producing areas of Australia, there is insufficient irrigation water to supplement rainfall fully and yields are often limited by water. Irrigation strategies developed for full irrigation systems may not always apply to supplementary systems with limited water. Drawn together in this paper are the results of replicated field trials, crop simulations and investment analysis to consider the long term benefits of installing and implementing supplementary irrigation in the Mackay and Atherton regions of Queensland, Australia. Large yield responses were obtained from relatively small but well-timed applications of water in two field experiments conducted from 1996 to 1997. Some of these responses were nearly as high as the theoretical maximum for the areas concerned. The mean response to irrigation simulated with the APSIM-Sugarcane model was similar to mean measured response. Simulations were then conducted to predict yearly fluctuations in yield response to supplementary irrigation applied in a variety of ways including winch, centre pivot and trickle irrigation systems, different scheduling options, different water allocations, different crop classes and different soils. Many of these options affected the yield response probability and some had a profound effect on the financial investment feasibility of supplementary irrigation. Change in the net present value over a 20-year term due to irrigation was as high as \$120 000 for a trickle system on a sandy soil at Mackay, and as low as -\$196 000 for a winch system on a clay soil at Atherton.},

	doi = {10.1006/jema.1998.0220},
	abstract = {Land degradation in the Philippine uplands is severe and widespread. Most upland areas are steep, and intense rainfall on soils disturbed by intensive agriculture can produce high rates of soil loss. This has serious implications for the economic welfare of a growing upland population with few feasible livelihood alternatives. Hedgerow intercropping can greatly reduce soil loss from annual cropping systems and has been considered an appropriate technology for soil conservation research and extension in the Philippine uplands. However; adoption of hedgerow intercropping has been sporadic and transient, rarely continuing once external support has been withdrawn. The objective of this paper is to investigate the economic incentives for farmers in the Philippine uplands to adopt hedgerow intercropping relative to traditional open-field maize farming. Cost-benefit analysis is used to compare the economic viability of hedgerow intercropping, as it has been promoted to upland farmers, with the viability of traditional methods of open-field farming. The APSIM and SCUAF models were used to predict the effect of soil erosion on maize yields from open-field farming and hedgerow intercropping. The results indicate that there have been strong economic incentives for farmers with limited planning horizons to reject hedgerow intercropping because the benefits of sustained yields are not realized rapidly enough to compensate for high establishment costs. Alternative forms of hedgerow intercropping such as natural vegetation and grass strips reduce establishment and maintenance costs and are therefore more economically attractive to farmers than hedgerow intercropping with shrub legumes. The long-term economic viability of hedgerow intercropping depends on the economic setting and the potential for hedgerow intercropping to sustain maize production relative to traditional open-field farming.

This defect can be transferred through mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into clonal SY5Y cells depleted of their mtDNA The resulting cytoplasmic hybrids or "cybrids" retain the complex TV defect and exhibit oxidative stress. We measured the mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi(m)) in AD and control cybrids via H-3-tetraphenylphosphonium ion (H-3-TPP+) accumulation. AD cybrids exhibited a significant (about 30\%) decrease in H-3-TPP+ accumulation relative to controls. Acute treatment of normal SY5Ys with azide, a COX inhibitor, moderately decreased H-3-TPP+ retention and strongly inhibited COX activity in a dose dependent manner. As the mitochondrial transition pore (MTP) can be activated by reactive oxygen species and ETC inhibitors, and its opening causes Delta psi(m) dissipation, we tested the effects of the MTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) on TPP+ accumulation. 5mM CsA increased basal H3-TPP+ accumulation in SY5Y cells about 10-fold, corresponding to about a 2-fold increase in Delta psi(m). In the AD cybrids, CsA increased the apparent Delta psi(m) to the same final levels as it did in controls. These results indicate that low-conductance;MTP activity contributes significantly to resting Delta psi(m) in SY5Y cells. We propose the novel hypothesis that the COX defect and resulting oxidative stress in AD may pathologically activate the MTP, resulting in lower Delta psi(m) and the release of mitochondrial factors involved in apoptosis.

	abstract = {The potential for cropping systems simulation to assist in the identification and quantification of 'exceptional circumstances' of drought impact on agriculture was assessed. The work focused on the grain production region of northeast Australia as a case study and used the crop-soil management simulator, APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator). Wheat and sorghum production was simulated for a range of cropping systems and locations and the results averaged as a notional per unit area 'farm production'. Moving averages over time bases from 1 to 4 years were used to examine variability and drought occurrence. Droughts over different time periods were identified in absolute terms (e.g. simulated production relative to a median or some lower percentile) or in probabilistic terms (e.g. the estimated recurrence interval or odds of experiencing a worse drought). The identification of droughts using agricultural systems simulation was contrasted with rainfall estimates of drought for the period of intel est and some differences in ranking were observed. As the simulated agricultural drought reflects the impact of factors such as rainfall timing, intensity, and amount and effects of soil water storage on cropping system performance, it is considered a superior measure of drought severity on farm performance. Sensitivity analyses revealed little to no effects of the choice of crop model or cropping system configuration (e,g, planting criteria) on the identification of exceptional drought circumstances.

	volume = {49},
	abstract = {A major issue for the sustainability of cropping systems is the maintenance of soil fertility and especially the supply of nitrogen to cereal crops. Choice of appropriate management strategies, including the role of legumes, is problematic, especially where climatic variation is large. Simulation models provide the means of extrapolation from the site- and season-specific bounds of experimental data to permit scenario analyses that can explore alternative management options. This paper is a status report on the capabilities of the APSIM modelling framework to simulate legume-cereal systems. APSIM deals with water and nitrogen constraints to crop growth and is well suited to the task of modelling whole systems involving crop rotations. The components that are not yet fully developed are modules for growing the legume crops and coupling these with the module describing the dynamics of soil organic matter to obtain sensible predictions of nitrogen supply to subsequent crops. Evidence is provided that those parts of the system that can be represented by current APSIM modules are predicted satisfactorily. The closest approach to a whole system that has been simulated to date is grass or legume (Stylosanthes hamata cv. Verano) leys followed by crops of maize or sorghum grown in experiments at Katherine, NT. Predictions of the yields of the leys and the cereal crops, especially the benefit from the legume leys to a second crop, were sufficiently close to measured yields to suggest that there are good prospects for developing useful models of other systems involving legumes and cereals. A simulation scenario exploring a chickpea-wheat system demonstrates how models can be used to analyse both productivity and sustainability aspects of the system.},

	abstract = {High rates of drainage and leaching of nitrates in deep sands in Western Australia are contributing to groundwater recharge and soil acidification in this region. Strategies are being sought to increase water and nitrogen (N) use in the legume-based cropping systems. Choice of appropriate management strategies is complicated by the diversity of soil types, the range of crops, and the inherent season to season variability. Simulation models provide the means to extrapolate beyond the bounds of experimental data if accurate predictions of key processes can be demonstrated. This paper evaluates the accuracy of predictions of soil water content, evapotranspiration, drainage, inorganic N content in soil, nitrate (NO3-) leaching, wheat growth, N uptake, and grain yields obtained from the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model when this was initialised with appropriate information on soil properties and wheat varieties commonly grown on deep sands in the 500 mm rainfall zone west of Moora in Western Australia. The model was found to give good predictions of soil water content, evapotranspiration, deep drainage, and overall NO3- leaching. Temporal changes in inorganic N in soil were simulated, although the small concentrations in soil inorganic N precluded close matching of paired observed and predicted values. Crop growth and N uptake were closely predicted up to anthesis, but a poor fit between observed and predicted crop growth and N uptake was noted post anthesis. Reasons for the discrepancies between modelled and observed values are outlined. The model was run with historical weather data (81 years) and different initial soil water and inorganic soil N profiles to assess the probability of drainage and NO3- leaching, and the grain yield potentials for wheat grown on deep sands in the region west of Moora. Simulation showed that the soil water and the soil inorganic N content at the beginning of each season had no effect on grain yield, implying that pre-seed soil NO3- was largely lost from the soil by leaching. There was a 50\% probability that 141 mm of winter rainfall could drain below 1.5 m and a 50\% probability that 53 kg N/ha could be leached under wheat following a lupin crop, where initial soil water contents and soil NO3- contents used in the model were those measured in a deep sand after late March rainfall. Simulated application of N fertiliser at sowing increased both grain yield and NO3- leaching. Splitting the N application between the time of sowing and 40 days after sowing decreased NO3- leaching, increased N uptake by wheat, and increased grain yield, findings which are consistent with agronomic practice. The high drainage and leaching potential of these soils were identified as the main reasons why predicted yields did not approach the French and Schultz potential yield estimates based on 20 kg grain yield per mm of rainfall. When the available cater was reduced by simulated drainage, simulated grain yields for the fertilised treatments approached the potential yield line.},

	abstract = {Sustainable irrigation guidelines that maximise profitability and minimise water losses and accession to the watertable are required for the new Ord Sugar Industry. In addition, knowledge on crop water requirements is needed to guide water allocation and costing policies for the expanding Ord Irrigation Area where sugarcane is likely to be a dominant crop. Field data indicating water requirements for sugar in the Ord Irrigation Area are few and this paper deploys a modelling approach to extrapolate from knowledge of water requirements in other parts of the world. The approach links long-term climatic data with soil water characteristics of the main soil type, with a cropping systems model, to develop indicative estimates of irrigation water requirement and yield consequences for different management options for sugarcane production in the Ord. Analyses of the growth of 12-month old ratoon crops were conducted using the APSIM-Sugarcane model with historical climatic data from 1960 to 1985 and either a deep (188 mm available water to 160 cm depth) or shallow (144 mm of water to 120 cm depth) Cununurra clay soil. Under maximum attainable growth conditions where crops were irrigated after half the soil water supply was depleted, average sucrose yield ranged from 26.7 to 29.0 t/ha, and the irrigation requirement (assuming 100\% application efficiency) ranged from 22.7 to 23.8 ML/ha depending on ratooning date. Soil water holding capacity had a major effect on the number of irrigations and the interval between irrigation for a given irrigation schedule but little effect on yield or irrigation requirement. Varying the irrigation schedule by changing the level of soil water depletion before irrigation and thus the irrigation frequency, showed the tradeoff between yield and irrigation requirement with the most profitable irrigation schedule depending on the price of sucrose and the cost of irrigation relative to other costs. Most of the year-to-year variation in irrigation water requirement could be explained by the highly variable effectiveness in soil storage of rainfall which ranged from 44 to 93\%. This study has provided insight and indicative estimates of the yield and irrigation requirements for different irrigation management options for use in the establishment of an Ord River sugar industry. These estimates will be further refined as field data become available.},

	abstract = {Cropping systems in south-eastern Queensland have led to degradation of soil physical properties and loss of infiltration capacity. Pasture leys are favoured for ameliorating soil physical properties because they add organic matter to the soil, create macroporosity, and help to re-aggregate soil. We measured change in hydraulic conductivity with period of ley for 5 major soil groups in south-eastern Queensland (Sodosols, light and heavy Vertosols, Red Ferrosols, and Red Chromosols/Kandosols). We characterised 2 soil layers that are susceptible to degradation when cropped: surface soil exposed to raindrop impact, and the layer immediately below the cultivated layer (0.1-0.2 m deep). A rainfall simulator was used to measure hydraulic conductivity of surface seals under high intensity rainfall. Disc permeameters and pressure plate apparatus were used to measure hydraulic conductivity of the soil matrix in the 0.1-0.2 m layer. Hydraulic conductivity of both soil layers improved with period of pasture for all but the light-textured Red Chromosols/Kandosols. The estimated period of pasture required to return hydraulic conductivity to pre-cultivated levels ranged from 5 to 40 years, depending on soil type and layer. This is about 2-3 times the period of cultivation that caused the degradation. Grazing reduced the effectiveness of pasture in ameliorating surface sealing on Sodosols. Beneficial effects of a 2.5-4.5 year, ungrazed ley pasture on surface soil persisted for up to 5 years after recultivation, but were lost in the 0.1-0.2 m layer within 1 year. These rates of decline in hydraulic conductivity were faster than observed on previously uncultivated soils. The APSIM model was used to predict the effect of measured improvements in soil hydraulic conductivity on average runoff from summer fallows. The model predicted that most benefits for fallow runoff would be achieved with 2-5 years of ley. The surface seal was the major limitation to infiltration when the soil was bare. Subsurface soil layers limited infiltration if surface sealing was reduced by ameliorating soil properties or maintaining cover on the soil surface. The results suggest that despite amelioration of soil structure with leys, appropriate tillage and cover management is still required to maintain high infiltration rates.},

	abstract = {The climatic and biological limits to sugarcane production are assessed in the context of the Australian sugar industry. The APSIM-Sugarcane simulation model, encapsulating knowledge of crop response to temperature and radiation, was coupled to historical climatic data to establish potential yields for different locations in Australia. In tropical regions, average sugar yield ranges from 22 to 31 t ha -1 year -1, with some lowering of potential (e.g. down to 18-24 t ha -1 year -1) in the cooler environments of southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. In tropical regions, low solar radiation associated with high rainfall results in potential sugar yields not being closely related to latitude. In contrast in the subtropics, yields decline with increasing latitude in response to decreasing temperature and radiation. Climate is shown to be only one factor limiting the performance of the Australian sugar industry. At all locations, simulated potential yields are above actual yields except for a small proportion of growers' fields. Consequently, from a climate perspective, there is considerable scope to raise productivity per hectare. Scope also exists at the farm, mill district and industry scales for growers, millers and marketers all to benefit from forecasting and scheduling practices that better utilise the climatic resources available to the industry.},

	abstract = {It is argued that effective crop modelling must combine `scientific' modelling to enhance understanding and generality with `engineering' modelling to retain a focus on prediction and problem-solving. Developments in crop modelling of sorghum, interaction with research to improve scientific understanding, and the interaction with decision-making to pursue improved practices are considered, with the focus on activities relevant to sorghum in Australia. The Agricultural Production System Simulator (APSIM) has been developed to simulate crop production, soil fertility, soil erosion and drainage from dryland grain production systems in Australia. APSIM includes a generic crop template, which incorporates subroutines for crop growth and development. The interaction of modelling with research has progressed in two key areas. Firstly, crop physiology field research activities have been designed around perceived weaknesses in the modelling capability, particularly water-by-nitrogen interactions, allocation of carbohydrate to grain, and dynamics of tillering. Crop-soil-climate databases also have an important role in the co-ordination of this work. Secondly, there has been interaction of modelling with genotypic improvement research. Specific examples of the use of sorghum modelling for assessing hypotheses about trait action and value are presented. Modelling has also improved decision-making by evaluating potential crop management decision options. Relevant and effective communication processes and participation of farmers/advisers are essential components in this interaction. The effect of time of planting on sorghum is used to explore these issues as simulation analyses and the way in which farmer/adviser perceptions differed. A flexible look-up database, `Whopper Cropper', is presented as a means to provide access to simulation analyses of decision options in a form most relevant to farmers/advisers. An example showing the potential use of seasonal forecasting in nitrogen fertilizer decisions is presented and discussed.},

	abstract = {Two models that differ markedly in how they represent the crop-soil system have been used to simulate soil processes and crop production in the long-term experiment at Hermitage Research Station, Warwick, Queensland. The experiment was designed to examine the effects of tillage, stubble management, and nitrogen (N) fertiliser on the productivity of a winter cereal-summer fallow cropping system. It commenced in 1968 and the treatments have been maintained until the present. CENTURY operates on a monthly time step, considers all soil N transformations to occur in a single soil layer, and has a very simple crop growth routine that does not deal with crop phenology. APSIM provides a framework whereby a model of a cropping system is configured from component modules, which operate on a daily time step. For simulating the Hermitage experiment, modules to represent the dynamics of soil-water, N, surface residues, and growth of a wheat crop were used. The water and N modules deal with a multilayered soil, whilst the wheat module develops leaf area, intercepts light, and accumulates and partitions dry matter in response to weather, soil-water, and N. Both models were specified to simulate the whole experimental period (1969-92) as a continuous run. The ability of these models to simulate grain yields, soil-water and drainage, nitrate-N, and soil organic matter were examined. Both models predict, in agreement with the observed data, that for this continuous cereal cropping system there has been a decline in soil organic matter for all the treatments and a reduction through time in the capacity of the soil to mineralise and accumulate nitrate during the fallows. CENTURY performed better than APSIM in predicting the relative yields of the N treatments but was less satisfactory than APSIM for absolute grain yield, soil-water, and drainage. Yield predictions with APSIM were sensitive to carry-over errors in the water balance from one season to the next, so that in some seasons large errors occurred in the predicted relative yields. Both models reproduced the observations well enough to indicate their suitability for providing useful insights into the behaviour of cropping systems where the focus is on depletion of soil fertility.},

	shorttitle = {An alternative approach to whole-farm deficit irrigation analysis},
	abstract = {Uncertainty exists as to the optimum whole-farm irrigation strategy for wheat growing in subtropical Australia under water-limited conditions. While deficit irrigation has been shown to have greater economic water productivity (EWP) in such circumstances in other regions, there are limitations to the cost/revenue function approach traditionally used to evaluate EWP, including inapplicability across environments. These limitations can however be overcome with the use of a validated cropping systems model. The APSIM farming systems model was therefore used to determine whether growing larger areas of deficit irrigated wheat is more profitable than full irrigation of a smaller area in sub-tropical Australia, under water limited conditions. Optimal irrigation strategies were not only profitable but also those considered risk-efficient, i.e. closest to a 1:2 'line of indifference' that identifies the two unit increase in risk (measured as standard deviation) acceptable to farmers in return for a unit increase in profit. The value of stored soil water was assessed by simulating rainfed crop production on unirrigated land, and/or assigning an economic value to stored soil water remaining at the end of the season. The results demonstrated that deficit irrigation of larger areas of wheat was generally more profitable and risk-efficient than smaller areas of full irrigation. When precipitation or stored soil water at sowing was increased, the most risk-efficient strategies were those that spread water across a larger area at a reduced frequency of irrigation. However in a low rainfall environment when water was expensive and soil water had the same economic value as irrigation water, fully irrigating a smaller area was the most profitable and risk-efficient option. The importance of evaluating farm-management strategies using EWP (i.e. incorporating gross margins) instead of crop water productivity (grain yield per unit of water use) was evident, as re-ranking of farm-management strategies occurred between these alternative methods of calculating whole-farm WP. Accounting for the intrinsic value of stored soil water and precipitation was fundamental to understanding the benefit of deficit irrigation strategies in water limited situations, as the larger crop area sown in conjunction with deficit irrigation strategies accessed much larger absolute volumes of soil water and precipitation. Future evaluations of deficit irrigation strategies should account for such considerations. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Higher temperatures caused by future climate change will bring more frequent heat stress events and pose an increasing risk to global wheat production. Crop models have been widely used to simulate future crop productivity but are rarely tested with observed heat stress experimental datasets. Four wheat models (DSSAT-CERES-Wheat, DSSAT-Nwheat, APSIM-Wheat, and WheatGrow) were evaluated with 4years of environment-controlled phytotron experimental datasets with two wheat cultivars under heat stress at anthesis and grain filling stages. Heat stress at anthesis reduced observed grain numbers per unit area and individual grain size, while heat stress during grain filling mainly decreased the size of the individual grains. The observed impact of heat stress on grain filling duration, total aboveground biomass, grain yield, and grain protein concentration (GPC) varied depending on cultivar and accumulated heat stress. For every unit increase of heat degree days (HDD, degree days over 30 degrees C), grain filling duration was reduced by 0.30-0.60\%, total aboveground biomass was reduced by 0.37-0.43\%, and grain yield was reduced by 1.0-1.6\%, but GPC was increased by 0.50\% for cv Yangmai16 and 0.80\% for cv Xumai30. The tested crop simulation models could reproduce some of the observed reductions in grain filling duration, final total aboveground biomass, and grain yield, as well as the observed increase in GPC due to heat stress. Most of the crop models tended to reproduce heat stress impacts better during grain filling than at anthesis. Some of the tested models require improvements in the response to heat stress during grain filling, but all models need improvements in simulating heat stress effects on grain set during anthesis. The observed significant genetic variability in the response of wheat to heat stress needs to be considered through cultivar parameters in future simulation studies.},

	abstract = {Root water uptake is an essential component of crop models since it affects plant growth and, through its effect on the soil water balance, multiple soil and nutrient cycling processes. Several methods to simulate water uptake exist; however, the differences among them have not been evaluated. We compared the water uptake methods implemented in six crop models: APSIM, CropSyst, DSSAT, EPIC, SWAP and WOFOST. These methods range from simple empiric approaches (WOFOST) to mechanistic approaches based on the water potential gradient and root distribution in the soil-plant system (CropSyst). We compared the six models' water uptake algorithms in scenarios with different evaporative demand, soil texture, and water distribution with depth. The main difference among methods derived from the degree to which each model enabled the use of water in the subsoil (below 0.5 m). In a rooted, 1-m deep silt loam soil in which the root density decreased geometrically with depth and which was subjected to an evaporative demand of 5 mm d(-1) for 60 days, APSIM, EPIC, DSSAT and SWAP transpired about 83\% of the total plant available water while SWAP and CropSyst transpired about 65\% of it. When methods were compared with initially dry bottom soil layers, cumulative transpiration became similar for all methods, while the opposite initial condition exacerbated differences. All methods, except CropSyst, increased transpiration as the evaporative demand rose to relatively high rates (10 mm d(-1)) because they lack a feedback mechanism that reduces transpiration when the demand exceeds the plant's ability to conduct water. CropSyst, DSSAT, EPIC and SWAP developed a drying front, as usually observed in field conditions, while APSIM and WOFOST showed relatively uniform water depletion with depth in the soil profile. In conclusion, the models differ meaningfully in their simulation of water uptake and careful consideration of these differences is needed to properly use and interpret the outcome of model simulations.

	abstract = {Carbon (C) sequestration in agricultural soil has the potential to mitigate climate change and help sustain soil productivity. Continual nutrient input and residue retention are needed to attain the C sequestration potential and to maintain the sequestered C. However, few studies have assessed the vulnerability of the sequestered soil C to changes in agricultural management and climate. Here we applied the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to simulate the soil C dynamics to equilibrium under optimal management with 100\% residue retention and no nitrogen (N) deficiency at 613 sites across the Australian croplands. We examined the response of sequestered soil C to potential warming and rainfall change, under these optimal practices and under suboptimal management with reduced residue retention and/or N input. On average, soil C was lost at rate of 0.14 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) when residue retention was halfed. Removing all residues doubled the rate of C loss (i.e., 0.28 Mg C ha(-1) y(r-)1). Reducing the application rate by half of the optimal N rate or to zero led to C loss of 0.089 and 0.27 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Multivariate linear regression analysis indicated that C loss rate increased with active C stock (non-inert C) in the sequestered C. Given an active C stock, the loss rate increased with increasing temperature and/or rainfall. Future warming was estimated to increase soil C loss, especially in cooler and/or wetter regions. The effect of potential rainfall change was relatively moderate and depended on the direction (increase or decrease) of rainfall change. Management strategies for effective C sequestration in agroecosystems should and can be developed based on local climatic conditions and soil specific amount of active organic C.

	doi = {10.1017/S0021859615000295},
	abstract = {Dairy farms are under pressure to increase productivity while reducing environmental impacts. Effective fertilizer management practices are critical to achieve this. In the present study the effect of timing and rate of nitrogen (N) fertilizer application on pasture production and N losses, either via direct leaching of fertilizer N or indirectly through consumption of N in pasture and subsequent excretion via dairy cow grazing, was modelled. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) was first tested with experimental data from N fertilizer response experiments conducted on a well-drained soil in the Waikato region of New Zealand. The model was then used in a 20-year simulation to investigate the effect of fertilizer management on the impacts on potential N leaching losses. Year-to-year variability was assessed by incorporating 20 years of climate data into the model. Modelling indicated that N fertilization at rates of 140 and 220 kg N/ha/year, applied in four split applications and avoiding application in winter months, could increase pasture yield on average by 2.2-3.0 t dry matter (DM)/ha (25-38\%). There were some significant amounts of direct leaching in some years, related to environmental conditions. The maximum loss was as high as 61 kg N/ha at an N application rate of 220 kg N/ha/year, in a year with low pasture production and high rainfall following fertilizer application. In general, however, the risk of direct N leaching from applied fertilizer was low. It seems the main effect of N fertilization is to increase the risk of indirect N leaching, due to increased N intake and excretion. The modelling indicated that the major contribution to increased indirect N leaching risk was from the extra DM grown (more urine deposited per ha). Increased N concentration in the pasture due to fertilization and the resultant extra partitioning of excretal N to urine had only a minor effect on indirect leaching losses. The exception was N fertilizer applied in late winter/early spring (July), where fertilizer N (55 kg/ha) increased pasture N concentration by c. 25\%, suggesting that the N concentration in urine patch areas could increase from c. 550 to 840 kg N/ha. Further measurements are required to test the hypothesis developed from the modelling that the main effect of N fertilizer on urinary N leaching is by increasing DM production rather than increasing pasture N concentration.},

	abstract = {The effectiveness of growing winter cover crops to mitigate nitrogen (N) leaching can be widely variable, even within a single climatic zone. We sought to investigate key drivers of this variability for the Canterbury Plains of New Zealand. First, through an analysis of local field experiments, we quantified the local variability in the effectiveness of cover crops to reduce N leaching. We then calibrated and applied a biophysical model to isolate the impact of potential drivers of this variability. Crop management (cover crop sowing date), soil water holding capacity (WHC) and inter-annual weather variability (30 years of historical climate) were selected as main factors to be investigated. The analysis of local literature showed that, compared to fallow treatments, winter cover crops reduced N leaching by an average (+/- 95\% CI) of 17 +/- 8.2 kg N ha(-1). This represented a median N leaching reduction of similar to 50\% with a wide interquartile range (6-75\%). The modelling study showed that the delay in sowing dates consistently reduced the average effectiveness of cover crops, from {\textgreater}80\% for March- to {\textless}25\% for June-sown crops. For any "sowing date by soil WHC" scenario, there was also a large year to year variability. This was caused by the stochastic effect of inter-annual weather variability on the dynamics of crop N demand and soil N supply. For the conditions assumed in the modelling study, a sensitivity analysis of simulated results showed that sowing dates were the main contributor to total variability in the effectiveness of cover crops, followed by weather, factor interactions and soil WHC. These results suggest the need for caution when interpreting data from individual field trials due to the impact of inter-annual variability and interactions among multiple drivers on cover crop effectiveness. In addition, our analysis highlights the value of complementary methodologies, such as biophysical modelling, for extending the inference space of individual field studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The APSIM simulation study showed that the mean soybean yield ranged from 1.0 to 1.6 t ha(-1) for the different dates of sowing. The average wheat grain yield was 3.2-3.9 t ha(-1), whereas, the crop sown on 15 November gave the highest yield.

Among the various irrigation practices simulated, five irrigations of 60 mm at 20 days interval was the best option for wheat. Application of 16 t FYM ha(-1) to soybean produced 50 \% higher wheat yield than the same amount of FYM applied to wheat. The wheat yield obtained from inorganic application of N was at par with that obtained from the application of integrated and organic sources. However, the amount of N loss from the integrated use of fertilizer N was lower than that from the current recommended practice for the region. Application of FYM alone or in combination with inorganic fertilizer maintained higher soil organic carbon concentration as compared to the application of inorganic fertilizer alone.

	abstract = {Modelling plant growth provides a tool for evaluating interactions between environment and management of forage crops for pasture-based livestock systems. Consequently, biophysical and farm systems models are becoming important tools for studying production systems that are based on forage crops. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) is a model with the potential to compare the growth of annual forage crops and perennial pastures. However, information is limited about how accurately the Lucerne and Weed modules represent the growth and development of forage crops and pastures under different managements, soil types and environments in South America. This study evaluated the capacity of APSIM to simulate the growth rates and predict the dry matter (DM) yield of Lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) and annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) in contrasting climatic regions of Argentina. In addition, at several Australian locations, DM yields of both crops were simulated to ensure that possible changes to the model not interfere with the robust APSIM performance that was already shown in south-eastern Australia. Initial simulations for Lucerne and ryegrass were made with original Lucerne and Weed modules of APSIM, respectively. Simulated DM yield was then compared with field data collected from the same crops grown in five locations in the Argentine Pampas and seven locations in south-eastern Australia over 5 of years. APSIM predicted DM yield of Lucerne at each harvest with reasonable accuracy [0.59, 0.77 and 0.77 for R-2, correlation coefficient and concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), respectively]. However, these statistics improved when the DM yield was analysed by annual accumulation, with values of 0.87, 0.93 and 0.92 for R-2, correlation coefficient and CCC, respectively. APSIM, generally, over-predicted DM yield of annual ryegrass at the first harvest. Nonetheless, when the Weed module was modified through changes in phenology and transpiration efficiency, performance improved (values of 0.89, 0.94 and 0.93 for 82, correlation coefficient and CCC, respectively). This study showed that annual DM yield of Lucerne can be successfully modelled by the APSIM Lucerne module without any modifications, using a crop modelling approach. However, successfully modelling of Lucerne DM yield by harvest will require further development of the model. Moreover, modification of model parameters associated with phenology and transpiration was required to enable the Weed module of APSIM simulate growth and yield of annual ryegrass in a range of geographic locations within the Argentine Pampas.

Field experiments and computer simulations were conducted to understand the effect of supplemental irrigation, type of cultivar and time of sowing (using simulation) on grain yield and quality of two wheat varieties EGA Gregory and Livingston. There was significant effect of variety and watering regime on grain yield, harvest index, kernel weight and number and protein content. The maximum grain yield of 6.10 t ha(-1) was obtained from the irrigated mid-late flowering variety EGA Gregory in the year the crop was sown early. The effect of irrigation on the late flowering variety EGA Gregory was higher than that on the early flowering variety Livingston. The grain water use efficiency of EGA Gregory was higher than that of Livingston in the year it was sown early. APSIM simulations of yield using historical weather data of the past 114 years show that as the sowing date is delayed, the decrease in yield of EGA Gregory becomes higher than that of Livingston and by mid June sowing, the grain yield of Livingston becomes higher than that of EGA Gregory. As the sowing is delayed, the differences between the anthesis dates, and also grain yields of the two varieties get smaller. The simulation results show that the grain yield of late-sown EGA Gregory and Livingston increases with the amount of in-crop rainfall. However, when sown early, the yield of Livingston decreases with the amount of in-crop rainfall. Farmers need to have different cultivars on hand and sow according to seasonal condition. An early-sown mid-lateflowering cultivar is less risky. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We explored the extent to which various crop and pasture management options affect changes in SOC from a sub-tropical to a temperate environment. Specifically, we examined how nitrogen fertilisation, stubble management and stocking rate affect SOC and what strategies might be employed by farmers to increase SOC sequestration across eastern Australia. We modelled a continuous cropping regime, a continuously grazed pasture and a mixed cropping and pasture rotation. Under continuous cropping higher nitrogen application and higher amounts of stubble incorporation increased the SOC levels at all locations. At Roma, the northern-most site, there was little additional gain in SOC from increasing N above 70 kg N ha(-1) whereas most other sites showed benefits above 70 kg N ha(-1). The biggest factor in boosting SOC under cropping was the level of stubble incorporation. At all but one site, continuously grazed pasture generally resulted in SOC increases over the},

Several empirical models have been developed to predict the growth and biomass accumulation of tropical forages, especially for the genera Cynodon, Paspalum, Panicum and Brachiaria. Their application, however, is often location or region specific. The adaptation of mechanistic models to accurately predict biomass accumulation in tropical grasses is still limited. Recent advances have been made on the plot-scale and farm-scale process-based models ALMANAC, CROPGRO Perennial Forage and agricultural production systems simulator (APSIM), with promising results. In addition, global-scale process-based models, such as the Century Agroecosystem Model and the Orchidee Grassland Management Model, have been tested for tropical grassland areas. A greater number of region-specific calibrations of empirical models can enhance their use, and improved databases and model parameterizations for a wide range of tropical grasses will enable the continuous improvement of mechanistic models.},

	abstract = {It is important to quantify the nitrogen (N) uptake and dinitrogen (N-2) fixation of legumes and estimate the N contribution that these crops make to subsequent crops for sustainable agricultural production. The growth and development of legumes and their impact on soil N fertility can be simulated by the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM). However, the model performance has not been evaluated in simulating the dynamic processes of N accumulation and N-2 fixation. The parameterised model was tested for the simulation of N uptake and N-2 fixation in above-ground biomass of four crop legumes (lupin, chickpea, field pea and peanut). The simulations varied in location, cultivar, sowing date, climate, soil type, water regime (irrigated or dryland) and starting soil N and applied fertiliser N in tropical, subtropical, semiarid and Mediterranean environments across Australia. In general, the absolute amount of N uptake and N-2 fixation in above-ground biomass (unit: kg ha(-1)) were reasonably well simulated, with 92\% of the variation in observed N accumulation in above-ground biomass and 84\% in N-2 fixation being explained by APSIM. The model was also able to simulate the responses of N-2 fixation by chickpea and peanut to differences in soil mineral N status. However, the simulations of N-2 fixation efficiency (NFE, calculated as fixed N-2 per unit above-ground dry matter (DM; unit: g N kg(-1) DM) were much less accurate, especially for lupin. Sensitivity analysis showed that improving the definition of the model parameter of crop N-2 fixing capacity (the potential to fix atmospheric N-2 per unit above-ground DM; unit: g N g(-1) DM) would improve the simulations of NFE. We therefore propose that to successfully simulate the absolute amount of N accumulation and N-2 fixation, the above-ground biomass as the major driving factor must first be simulated well, and future work should focus on accurately determining the parameter of crop N-2 fixing capacity through optimisation of N-2 fixation data obtained from field or controlled experiments to fine-tune the simulations of the relative efficiency of N-2 fixation.

	abstract = {23\% of global agricultural land are situated in the subtropics. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were estimated to be higher under subtropical than under temperate climates. So mitigation of N2O emissions from subtropical farming systems can make an important contribution to reducing global warming. Accordingly, in this study we explored long-term N2O emissions and possible mitigation options for representative subtropical cropping systems (e.g., summer versus winter crops, inclusion of a legume in the rotation) and management practices (nitrogen fertilizer, irrigation) by calculating scenarios with the agricultural systems model APSIM. The model was tested against high temporal frequency data from experiments conducted on an oxisol and a vertisol in subtropical Australia, which comprised a number of fertilization and irrigation treatments. The threshold of water filled pore space above which denitrification starts was calibrated on a subset of the data while the rest of the large number of parameters controlling the carbon and nitrogen cycles were kept to default values. The validity of the model was confirmed with 11 validation data sets for yields of four different crops (R-2=0.92) and 16 validation data sets for seasonal N2O emissions during crop and fallow periods (R-2 = 0.77). While these results show that the model performs well in sub-tropical environments, this modeling skill might not translate to other environments and the model would benefit from wider testing. In the scenario analyses, long-term average N2O emissions from wheat, cotton, maize and sorghum were predicted to vary between 0.2 and 6.1 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and showed large interannual variability of N2O emissions. This highlights the risk that results from short-term experiments may not be representative for the long-term behavior of these agro-ecosystems, and thus the value simulation studies add to experiments. The scenario analysis revealed that long-term average yields and N2O emissions increased in response to the same management practices (e.g., increase in nitrogen rate), leading to a trade-off between maximizing yield and minimizing N2O emissions. When crop yields were limited due to water stress either by low seasonal rainfall or by lack of irrigation, average N2O emissions increased. Given the annual variability in climate and soil nitrogen stocks, mitigating N2O emissions without compromizing in yield is not a simple task but requires an optimal nitrogen management considering other limiting factors such as water supply.

An over-winter cover crop in a maize-soybean rotation offers multiple potential benefits that can reduce the impacts of higher temperatures and more variable rainfall; some of the anticipated changes for the Midwest. In this experiment we used the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to understand how winter rye cover crops impact crop production and environmental outcomes, given future climate change. We first tested APSIM with data from a long-term maize-soybean rotation with and without winter rye cover crop field site. Our modeling work predicted that the winter rye cover crop has a neutral effect on maize and soybean yields over the 45 year simulation period but increases in minimum and maximum temperatures were associated with reduced yields of 1.6-2.7\% by decade. Soil carbon decreased in both the cover crop and no cover crop simulations, although the cover crop is able to significantly offset (3\% less loss over 45 years) this decline compared to the no cover crop simulation. Our predictions showed that the cover crop led to an 11-29\% reduction in erosion and up to a 34\% decrease in nitrous oxide emissions (N2O). However, the cover crop is unable to offset future predicted yield declines and does not increase the overall carbon balance relative to current soil conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {We used the APSIM model to explore the ability to simulate soil organic carbon (SOC) from three long term agricultural experiments (LTAE) over 24-44 years in eastern Australia (Hamilton Victoria, Wagga Wagga New South Wales and Warwick Queensland). The model was initialized for each location soil type using a 20-year spin-up period to reach stable SOC fractions. The model was not tuned to any of the data at each site. The cropping systems model simulated reasonably well the calculated changes in SOC over the 24-44-year period at the three different sites under various agronomic management practices. At Hamilton calculated SOC did not change significantly over 32 years and the APSIM-Agpasture model represented this satisfactorily. Root mean square error was 4.9 t C ha(-1) (0-30 cm) (5.2\%) ranging from 1.5 to 10.9 t C ha(-1) (1.7 to 11.8\%) over time. Similarly, over twenty-four years of continuous cropping at Wagga Wagga under a Wheat-Lupin crop rotation using APSIM-Wheat and APSIM-Lupin under stubble retention and zero tillage showed a largely neutral trend over time with RMSE of 3.4 t C ha(-1) (0-30 cm) (9.5\%) ranging from 1.4 to 7.8 t C ha(-1) (4 to 21\%) over time. The SOC was much lower at Wagga Wagga compared to that at Hamilton. Forty-four years of continuous cropping at the Queensland site resulted in significant declines in SOC irrespective of the farming practices applied. However, the rates of decline were different with the least decline achieved from high N application with stubble retention. The modelled changes, using APSIM-Wheat and APSIM-Barley, in SOC matched reasonably well the calculated behaviour with the greatest decline under zero N application with overall RMSE of 4.1 t C ha(-1) (0-30 cm) (4.5\%) ranging from 1.4 to 8.7 t C ha(-1) (2 to 7\%) overtime. The biophysical simulation model exemplified by the APSIM model explained well the observed changes in SOC at the various locations without specifically fitting the model to the observed data, despite large variation in the calculated data. This indicates that the SOC model was robust over the moderate to long term period. As such the model is suitable to extrapolate a simulated response beyond these locations under various treatment combinations that should predict realistic SOC stocks within the expected mean error of less than 10\% (3 to 6 t C ha(-1) 0-30 cm).

	abstract = {Agricultural systems are being challenged to decrease water use and increase production while climate becomes more variable and the world's population grows. Low water use efficiency is traditionally characterized by high water use relative to low grain production and usually occurs under dry conditions. However, when a cropping system fails to take advantage of available water during wet conditions, this is also an inefficiency and is often detrimental to the environment. Here, we provide a systems-level definition of water use efficiency (sWUE) that addresses both production and environmental quality goals through incorporating all major system water losses (evapotranspiration, drainage, and runoff). We extensively calibrated and tested the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) using 6years of continuous crop and soil measurements in corn- and soybean-based cropping systems in central Iowa, USA. We then used the model to determine water use, loss, and grain production in each system and calculated sWUE in years that experienced drought, flood, or historically average precipitation. Systems water use efficiency was found to be greatest during years with average precipitation. Simulation analysis using 28years of historical precipitation data, plus the same dataset with +/- 15\% variation in daily precipitation, showed that in this region, 430mm of seasonal (planting to harvesting) rainfall resulted in the optimum sWUE for corn, and 317mm for soybean. Above these precipitation levels, the corn and soybean yields did not increase further, but the water loss from the system via runoff and drainage increased substantially, leading to a high likelihood of soil, nutrient, and pesticide movement from the field to waterways. As the Midwestern United States is predicted to experience more frequent drought and flood, inefficiency of cropping systems water use will also increase. This work provides a framework to concurrently evaluate production and environmental performance of cropping systems.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested that during the first half of the 21st century food production will need to increase by 50-70\% using nearly the same amount of land, and under increasing pressures of climate change, to meet the demand of an increasingly crowded world. The challenge is significant, though there are also opportunities, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where productivity gaps are largest. Here we report results from a participatory modeling exercise that aimed to identify feasible pathways for the sustainable intensification of agriculture in Manica Province, Mozambique. We used a combination of farmer questionnaires (n = 52) and a cropping systems model (APSIM) to derive the likely causes and magnitude of existing gaps in maize yield, and agronomic nitrogen use efficiency. Results showed highly variable (i.e. season to season and site-to-site - 35\% and 42\% CV respectively) maize yields regardless of nitrogen input use. Variability in soil fertility status and basic agronomic management (primarily sowing density) were the main drivers explaining site-to-site variability, while rainfall explained much of the season-to-season variability. Best-practice sowing densities (1 to 4.5 pl./m(2)) were dependent on farmers' N inputs and agro-ecology. In most cases, the highest simulated yields were observed at sowing densities far below those recommended by the local extension services (4.4 pl./m(2)). Estimates of returns on N inputs indicated that N fertilization was highly profitable for medium- and higher-performing farmers. Poor performing farmers could still make profits from investing in N fertilizers, but returns were lower than those of the better performers. We identified important knowledge gaps among the poorest performing smallholder. These gaps in knowledge related to simple principles of good agronomic practice e.g. suitable plant populations, row spacing and sowing dates. We estimate that if these issues were addressed (i.e. with present levels of on farm investment) maize production could be increased by 120\% from 309 kg/ha to 682 kg/ha, among 17\% of the population of farmers. We also calculated that by re-investing a fraction (a third) of the proceeds from improving productivity, a further increase in productivity of 64\% could be achieved, lifting yields from 682 kg/ha to 1118 kg/ha. We conclude that as a first stepping stone in lifting productivity, focus should aim to provide the poorer performing farmers simple recommendations for basic agronomic management that account for the specificities of local climate and soil conditions, before costly technological innovations (e.g. fertilizers, herbicides) are introduced.

Amongst the key challenges faced in developing such tools are the complexity of agroforestry, including interactions between various system components, and the large spatial domains and timescales over which trees and crops interact. A model that is flexible enough to simulate any agroforestry system globally should be able to address competition and complementarity above and below ground between trees and crops for light, water and nutrients. Most agroforestry practices produce multiple products including food, fiber and fuel, as well as income, shade and other ecosystem services, all of which need to be simulated for a comprehensive understanding of the overall system to emerge. Several agroforestry models and model families have been developed, including SCUAF, HyPAR, Hi-SAFE/Yield-SAFE and WaNuLCAS, but as of 2015 their use has remained limited for reasons including insufficient flexibility, restricted ability to simulate interactions, extensive parameterization needs or lack of model maintenance. An efficient approach to improving the flexibility and durability of agroforestry models is to integrate them into a well established modular crop modeling framework like APSIM. This framework currently focuses on field-scale crops and pastures, but has the capability to reuse or interoperate with existing models including tree, livestock and landscape models, it uses parameters that are intuitive and relatively easy to measure, and it allows scenario analysis that can include farm-scale economics. Various types of agroforestry systems are currently being promoted in many contexts, and the impacts of these innovations are often unclear. Rapid progress in reliable modeling of tree and crop performance for such systems is needed to ensure that agroforestry fulfills its potential to contribute to reducing poverty, improving food security and fostering sustainability.

	abstract = {Groundwater levels in the North China Plain (NCP), the bread basket of China, have dropped more than one meter per year over the last 40 years, putting at risk the long term productivity of this region. Groundwater decline is most severe in the Alluvial Fans where our study site is located. Avoiding a foreseeable systems collapse requires region-wide changes in crop systems management, underpinned by sound environmental policies. Here, we explore the potential of crop system adaptation to remedy the excessive water use and quantify the likely yield penalties associated with more sustainable water use practices. Using simulations with the APSIM cropping systems model we explore production opportunities in an area within the NCP with intensive cropping and no access to irrigation from rivers. We estimate the attainable production levels for wheat and maize if agriculture were made groundwater neutral, through changes in crop sequence, irrigation practices and water conservation technologies (e.g. mulching with plastic film). Total grain production would drop by 44\% compared to current practice if agriculture were made groundwater neutral. Water conservation by plastic film could limit this reduction to 21-33\% but possible environmental impacts of plastic film need attention. This analysis facilitates a much needed debate on alternative agronomic practices and incentives through a quantitative comparison of adaptation options. Our biophysical analysis needs to be complemented with socio-economic considerations and discussions with all stakeholders. Similar analyses in other parts of the NCP are possible but require more accurate modelling of landscape hydrology and (towards the coast) risk of salt water intrusion.

	abstract = {Wheat production is expected to be affected by climate change through changing components of the crop water balance such as rainfall, evapotranspiration (ET), runoff and drainage. We used the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM)-wheat model to simulate the potential impact of climate change on field water balance, ET and water use efficiency (WUE) under the SRES A2 emissions scenario. We ran APSIM with daily climate data statistically downscaled from 18 Global Circulation Models (GCMs). Twelve soil types of varying plant available water holding capacity (PAWC) at six sites across semi-arid southeastern Australia were considered. Biases in the GCM-simulated climate data were bias-corrected against observations for the 1961-1999 baseline period. However, biases in the APSIM output data relative to APSIM simulations forced with climate observations remained. A secondary bias correction was therefore performed on the APSIM outputs. Bias-corrected APSIM outputs for a future period (2021-2040) were compared with APSIM outputs generated using observations for the baseline period to obtain future changes. The results show that effective rainfall was decreased over all sites due to decreased growing season rainfall. ET was decreased through reduced soil evaporation and crop transpiration. There were no significant changes in runoff at any site. The variation in deep drainage between sites was much greater than for runoff, ranging from less than a few millimetres at the drier sites to over 100 mm at the wetter. However, in general, the averaged drainage over different soil types were not significantly different between the baseline (1961-1999) and future period of 2021-2040 (P {\textgreater} 0.05). For the wetter sites, the variations in the future changes in drainage and runoff between the 18 GCMs were larger than those of the drier sites. At the dry sites, the variation in drainage decreased as PAWC increased. Overall, water use efficiency based on transpiration (WUE\_T) and ET (WUE\_ET) increased by 1.1 to 1.6 and 0.7 to 1.3 kg ha(-1) mm(-1), respectively, over the baseline historical climate. Significant relationships between changes in wheat yield and PAWC were only seen at three sites. At the dry sites, the impact of a future climate under a soil of high PAWC was less than that under one of low PAWC. Conversely, the opposite response was seen at two wetter sites, highlighting the importance of PAWC and rainfall in determining the interactive response of crops to primary components of the water balance.},

	volume = {142},
	doi = {10.1016/j.agsy.2015.11.007},
	abstract = {There is interest by governments and private organisations in exploring alternative models of irrigation in parts of northern Australia where there has been little irrigation development to date. One alternative is 'water harvesting', which is defined here as the practice of pumping or diverting water during streamflow events and either applying directly to a crop or (more commonly) holding water in off-stream storage on a property for later use. This study presents a detailed farm-scale bio-economic analysis of water harvesting using river system modelling to represent the interactions between farm-scale returns, reliability of extraction and scale of development. In doing so the farm-scale viability of irrigation within a whole of catchment is assessed, and uses the Flinders catchment, a large, semi-arid tropical catchment in northern Australia as a case study. Extraction reliability varied spatially across the catchment and decreased with increasing total catchment extraction. The farm scale profitability of water harvesting enterprises was found to be particularly sensitive to fluctuations in price, reliability of water extraction, discount rate, cost of storage and timing of crop-failure years. For crops requiring off-site processing, the existence of local processing facilities was a major factor. This study also highlighted that for irrigation developments based on water harvesting there is potential for serious mismatches between the timing of streamflow and time at which planting must occur. For the cropping scenarios modelled here for the Flinders catchment it was found that mosaics of irrigation based on water harvesting and off-stream storage are unlikely to be profitable, and short to medium season crops provided the best return, although still negative. This is because land developed for irrigation of short to medium season crops returns no income for six or more months every year, while for permanent cropping the cost of constructing a storage that could provide water for irrigation throughout the year is prohibitively expensive. Assuming an optimal water storage to pump capacity ratio of 5, it was found that if an additional 240 GL of water were added to the existing 105 GL catchment entitlement, most new irrigators could extract their entitlement in approximately 70 to 80\% of years, discounting any environmental or legislative issues that would need to be addressed. At these reliabilities, most high value crops would require high prices to be sustained through the entire investment period (for which there is no historical precedent), to acquire a return equal to inflation. The method and results presented in this manuscript would be useful to water planners and regulators to help inform water allocation, pricing decisions and policy initiatives, particularly where agricultural development may be based on water harvesting.

A sensitivity analysis was used to assess the simulated impact on yield of a suite of traits involved in major processes of crop growth and development, and to evaluate how the simulated value of such traits varies across environments and in relation to other traits (which can be interpreted as a virtual change in genetic background). The study focused on wheat in Australia, with an emphasis on adaptation to low rainfall conditions.

	doi = {10.1016/j.agrformet.2015.10.012},
	abstract = {Grain yields vary widely between seasons in rain-fed agriculture. The yield variability is strongly influenced by rainfall variability and a number of related crop management decisions. This is well recognised in the literature through the use of seasonal rainfall forecasts applied to the main cropping decisions. However, the value of short-term 10-day rainfall forecasts for management decisions in cropping has not yet been quantified. Here we report on the potential benefits of a hypothetical, always-correct 10-day rainfall (greater than 10 mm in three days) forecast used to determine early and late in-season crop management decisions. Most of the analysed applications of short-term rainfall forecasts show a significant increase in cropping profitability depending on rainfall region and soil type. Using a 10-day rainfall forecast to dry-sow prior to the traditional start of sowing at the first autumn rainfall can yield an extra A\$20,000 to A\$200,000 for a typical farm (i.e. A\$10 to A\$100/ha for a 2000 ha cropping programme). The same forecast type can be used to determine late in-season decisions on N fertiliser, and fungicide applications to control rust at the end-of-ear growth stage. In the one-third of seasons with late rainfall, the increased yield or decreased fungal damage can lead to benefits of A\$10 to A\$160/ha. When 10-day rainfall forecasts are applied together within a season, the extra benefits from correct short-term forecasts can be cumulative. Fine-tuning the forecast length, rainfall thresholds and exploring other possible crop decisions could lead to further increased returns in cropping from short-term rainfall forecasts. Ultimately, using hind-casts of short-term rainfall forecasts to measure the forecast skill and the implication of occasional non-correct forecasts will determine the actual value of such forecasts.

	abstract = {Natural and artificial (e.g. agricultural) ecosystems confer benefits in the form of provisioning, regulating, cultural and habitat/supporting goods and services. Degradation of eco systems by natural and anthropogenic drivers compromises their ability to provide these goods and services. In Kenya, as in other regions worldwide, climate change and variability are driving weather pattern changes, and causing seasonal shifts. Such changing weather patterns and seasonal shifts act as stresses on agricultural ecosystems, compromising the production of agricultural goods and services, and leading to reduced farm returns, reduced household incomes, and increase in poverty levels. Using the example of Embu County in central Kenya as a case study, this study seeks to assess the impacts of climate change on household welfare (net farm returns, per capita incomes, and poverty) in current agricultural production systems. To address this objective we conducted a multi-disciplinary study involving climatologists, crop modellers and economic modellers. Primary data from 441 households were collected using a combination of stratified and multistage sampling. In climate modelling, 5 climate models were used to downscale future projected climate change scenarios for the mid-century timeframe of 2041-2070. Crop modelling for maize was done using DSSAT and APSIM crop models. Representative agricultural pathways were used to project the production of other non-modelled crops and dairy. Finally, economic analyses were done using the trade-off analysis multi-dimensional impact assessment tool. Results show that about 36 to 66\% of the households in agro-ecological zones (AEZs) receiving limited rainfall are likely to lose from climate change. In addition, crop models indicate mixed results for net farm returns, per capita income and poverty levels in different AEZs, with poverty level declines being between 0.6 and 3.8\% for APSIM, and between 0.7 and 11\% for DSSAT. This therefore calls for adaptation, especially for households in AEZs likely to experience negative impacts from climate change.},

We also disentangled the contributions of climate change, modern cultivars, sowing/transplanting density and fertilization management, as well as changes in each climate variables, to yield change in RWRS, in the past three decades. We found that change in sowing/transplanting date did not significantly affect rice and wheat yield in RWRS, although alleviated the negative impact of climate change to some extent. From 1981 to 2009, climate change jointly caused rice and wheat yield change by -17.4 to 1.5\%, of which increase in temperature reduced yield by 0.0-5.8\% and decrease in solar radiation reduced it by 1.5-8.7\%. Cultivars renewal, modern sowing/transplanting density and fertilization management contributed to yield change by 14.4-27.2, -4.7--0.1 and 2.3-22.2\%, respectively.

	abstract = {There is continued decline in per capita agricultural productivity in the drier parts of Kenya's central highlands. The declines have been linked to low and declining soil fertility, soil water, high atmospheric heat, prolonged dry-spells and erratic rainfall. Integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) technologies have been developed and tested in the region. Despite their significant impacts, high variability in local soils and climate contributes to large variations and inconsistency in research results among replications. Experimentation is expensive and limited to a few years, sites and scenarios. Crop-growth simulation models suitably complement experimental research, to support decision making regarding soil fertility and water management. This study evaluated the performance of the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model. APSIM was parameterized and calibrated based on a rain-fed randomized complete block trial (2009-2012) at a research station in Machang'a, Embu County. The study further reported on long-term effects of integrated Nitrogen (N) management from organic residues (goat manure, Lantana camara, Tithonia diversifolia and Mucuna pruriens) and their combination with mineral fertilizers in maize production. The model adequately reproduced the observed trends of maize leaf area index (LAI) and yield response to the test N amendments. Long-term simulations showed that application of 0, 20 and 40 Kg N ha -1 had low inter-seasonal variations (CV=18-33\%) in yields. High yield variability (CV {\textgreater}56\%) was observed in the application of 60 and 80 Kg N ha -1. Application of 40 Kg N ha -1 by combining mineral fertilizer and manure showed 80\% chance of harvesting more than 2.5 Mg ha -1 of maize grain yield. Maize stover mulching at 5 and 6 Mg ha -1 with the same N application increased long-term guaranteed grain harvests to 3.5 Mg ha -1. This is when complemented with 90 Kg P ha -1. This integrated N and soil water management is thus recommended. For subsistence farming, low-cost recommendations are geared towards some 'guaranteed' yield stability each cropping season. This recommendation underpins low-cost technologies that reduce production risks among small-holder farmers who faced with intermittent financial problems, to improve food security. However, there is need to evaluate and verify that there is a positive balance of primary nutrients such as N, P and K in such a fertility and water management option. Its effects on C:N levels ought to be evaluated as well.},

	abstract = {Using crop and soil data from agro-meteorological observational stations together with meteorological data from meteorological stations, the study evaluated the adaptability of APSIM-Wheat (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator-Wheat) model in winter wheat planting zones in Southwest China (SWC). Then, the model was used to calculate the potential and rainfed yields of winter wheat from 1961 to 2010 in SWC. The relative contribution rates of the changes in main climatic factors during crop growing season to the changes in simulated potential and rainfed yields of winter wheat were determined with the stepwise regression method. The study results showed that APSIM-Wheat model performed well in simulating phenology, above-ground biomass and yield of five representative winter wheat varieties in SWC. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between simulated and observed wheat phenology were less than 7.0 d for all the varieties. Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) between simulated and observed above-ground biomass and yield were lower than 25\% and 21\%, respectively, for all the varieties. Total solar radiation during wheat growing season decreased significantly at 36\% of the study stations centered in the northern, southeastern and mid-southern SWC. The effective accumulative temperature of not less than 0°C during wheat growing season increased significantly at 68\% of the study stations centered in the western SWC, while average diurnal temperature range during wheat growing season decreased significantly at 30\% of study stations centered in the mid-southern SWC ( P{\textless}0.05). Total precipitation during wheat growing season decreased at most of study stations centered in the southern and southeastern SWC from 1961 to 2010. As a result, simulated potential yield of winter wheat also showed a significant decline at 65\% of study stations, especially in the mid-southern and northern SWC. Simulated yield of rainfed wheat showed a significant decline at 25\% of study stations, especially in the northern SWC. The contribution rates of the decrease of solar radiation and diurnal temperature range, the increase of temperature during wheat growing season were 45\%, 2\% and 36\%, respectively, to the reduction in simulated potential yield, and 36\%, 39\% and -8\%, respectively, to the reduction in simulated yield of rainfed wheat. The contribution rate of decreasing precipitation during wheat growing season was 7\% to the reduction in simulated yield of rainfed wheat. In general, solar radiation and temperature had the most obvious effects on simulated yield variations of winter wheat in SWC from 1961 to 2010. The decrease in solar radiation and precipitation, and the increase in temperature during winter wheat growing season led to a decline in both simulated potential and rainfed yields at most of study stations in SWC, while the decreased diurnal temperature range had both negative and positive effects on potential and rainfed yields, respectively. Quantifying the impacts of light, temperature and precipitation on wheat production using APSIM model provided a sound foundation for taking countermeasures for adapting to climate change and improving wheat yield in Southwest China.},

	abstract = {Climate change is predicted to decrease crop yields in semi-arid and subtropical regions of the world and this could negatively affect smallholder farmers in the developing world. Previous analysis has suggested that with low fertiliser input, yields of sorghum increased as temperatures increased. We used the wide range of tropical environments in the small mountainous island country of Timor-Leste to evaluate the impact of global warming on maize (Zea mays) yields with (i) no fertiliser input and (ii) increased nitrogen (N) supply. We calibrated the well-tested APSIM-Maize model for the cultivar of maize grown throughout Timor-Leste. We simulated maize yields at four locations with 8 years of reliable weather records, at present temperatures, +1.5 degrees C and +3.0 degrees C, with 0, 40 and 80 kg/ha of added N, with 1.2, 1.9 and 3.8\% soil organic carbon (SOC), and with increased duration of the vegetative phase. With no added N, higher temperatures increased yields at the cooler, higher elevation sites and decreased yields at the warmest site near the coast. With fertiliser application, warming temperatures decreased yields or induced no change in simulated yield at all locations. Simulations with three levels of N: supply for the four sites, which differed in temperature, showed a strong temperature x N supply interaction on yield. At maximum growing-season temperatures {\textgreater}31 degrees C, yields decreased with increasing temperature at all levels of fertilisation. At maximum growing-season temperatures of 23-31 degrees C, yields increased with increasing temperature with no added fertiliser, were unchanged with the application of 40 kg N/ha, and decreased with increasing temperatures with application of 80 kg/ha N. The changes in yield with temperature and N supply were associated with N uptake by the maize, which showed the same interaction with maximum temperature and N added. SOC acted as a source of N, so that changes in yield induced by temperature and N were similar whether the N was from an organic or an inorganic source. Increasing the duration of the vegetative phase resulted in lower or no change in yields at all sites. We conclude that global warming will increase the yield for low-input smallholder farmers growing maize at maximum growing-season temperatures {\textless}31 degrees C, but that micro-dosing with N will increase yields at all locations with mean maximum temperatures of 20-35 degrees C.},

	abstract = {Investigation of land-use and management changes at regional scales require the linkage of farm-system models with land-resource information, which for pastoral systems includes forage supply. The New Zealand Land Resource Inventory (NZLRI) and associated Land Use Capability (LUC) database include estimates of the potential stock-carrying capacity across the country, which can be used to derive estimates of average annual pasture yields. Farm system models and decision support tools, however, require information on the seasonal patterns of pasture growth. To generate such pasture growth curves (PGCs), the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) was used, with generic soil profiles based on descriptions of LUC classes, to generate PGCs for three regions of New Zealand. Simulated annual pasture yields were similar to the estimates of annual potential pasture yield in the NZLRI spatial database, and they provided information on inter-annual variability. Simulated PGCs generally agreed well with measured long-term patterns of seasonal pasture growth. The approach can be used to obtain spatially discrete estimates of seasonal pasture growth patterns across New Zealand for use in farm system models and for assessing the impact of management practices and climate change on the regional sustainability.},

	abstract = {Droughts remain a threat to grape yields in South Africa. Previous studies on the impacts of climate on grape yield in the country have focussed on the impact of rainfall and temperature separately; meanwhile, grape yields are affected by drought, which is a combination of rainfall and temperature influences. The present study investigates the impacts of drought on grape yields in the Western Cape (South Africa) at district and farm scales. The study used a new drought index that is based on simple water balance (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index; hereafter, SPEI) to identify drought events and used a correlation analysis to identify the relationship between drought and grape yields. A crop simulation model (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator, APSIM) was applied at the farm scale to investigate the role of irrigation in mitigating the impacts of drought on grape yield. The model gives a realistic simulation of grape yields. The Western Cape has experienced a series of severe droughts in the past few decades. The severe droughts occurred when a decrease in rainfall occurred simultaneously with an increase in temperature. El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) appears to be an important driver of drought severity in the Western Cape, because most of the severe droughts occurred in El Nino years. At the district scale, the correlation between drought index and grape yield is weak (r approximate to-0.5), but at the farm scale, it is strong (r approximate to-0.9). This suggests that many farmers are able to mitigate the impacts of drought on grape yields through irrigation management. At the farm scale, where the impact of drought on grape yields is high, poor yield years coincide with moderate or severe drought periods. The APSIM simulation, which gives a realistic simulation of grape yields at the farm scale, suggests that grape yields become more sensitive to spring and summer droughts in the absence of irrigation. Results of this study may guide decision-making on how to reduce the impacts of drought on food security in South Africa.},

In this study, crop and daily weather data collected from six sites across the North China Plain were used to drive a crop model to analyze the impacts of climate change and cultivar development on the phenology and production of winter wheat from 1981 to 2005. Results showed that both the growth period (GP) and the vegetative growth period (VGP) decreased during the study period, whereas changes in the reproductive growth period (RGP) either increased slightly or had no significant trend. Although new cultivars could prolong the winter wheat phenology (0.3 similar to 3.8 days per decade for GP), climate warming impacts were more significant and mainly accounted for the changes. The harvest index and kernel number per stem weight have significantly increased. Model simulation indicated that the yield of winter wheat exhibited increases (5.0 similar to 19.4 \%) if new cultivars were applied. Climate change demonstrated a negative effect on winter wheat yield as suggested by the simulation driven by climate data only (-3.3 to -54.8 kg ha(-1) year(-1), except for Lushi). Results of this study also indicated that winter wheat cultivar development can compensate for the negative effects of future climatic change.},

The model was parameterised for, and validated against results from a long term (over 23 years) experiment comparing the system-burnt trash and green cane trash blanketing (GCTB), in Linhares-ES. Simulations were conducted over two crop cycles (14 years) with different management (100\%, 75\%, 50\%, 25\% GCTB and burnt trash), and N fertiliser rates from 0 to 240 kg ha(-1) (in 40 kg ha(-1) increments) on the ratoon crops, and 75\% of these rates on the plant crops. Measured cane yields and soil carbon were simulated well by the model. The RMSE (root mean square error) of predictions in burnt and GCTB treatments were 14.02 Mg ha(-1) and 13.45 Mg ha(-1) for yield, and 0.09 and 0.13\% for soil carbon. In the simulation, the cane yield responded positively to the GCTB systems. Optimum N rates were higher in the 100\%, 75\% and 50\% GCTB than with burnt trash and 25\% GCTB reflecting the greater yields under GCTB systems. The response to trash retention was dependent on N fertiliser, and it was smaller or even negative at lower N rates. With adequate N, the positive responses were predicted to occur in all crops after the imposition of GCTB system. The removal of any proportion of the trash reduced the potential sugarcane yield. The simulations showed that average environmental losses of N are likely to be greater from trash-retained systems at all N fertiliser rates.},

	abstract = {Maize yield productivity in Ethiopia has been below the genetic potential-constrained, among other factors, by frequent moisture stress due to local weather variability. Changes in climate may exacerbate these limitations to productivity, but current research on projecting responses of maize yields to climate change in Ethiopia is inadequate. The research objectives of this project were to (1) calibrate and evaluate the performance of the APSIM-maize and DSSAT CSM-CERES-Maize models, and (2) assess the impact of climate change on future maize yield. The climate periods considered were near future (2010-2039), middle (2040-2069) and end of the 21st century (2070-2099). Climate simulations were conducted using 20 General Circulation Models (GCMs) and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs; RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Both crop models reasonably reproduced observations for time to anthesis, time to physiological maturity and crop yields, with values for the index of agreement of 0.86, 0.80 and 0.77 for DSSAT, and 0.50, 0.89 and 0.60 for APSIM. Similarly root mean square errors were moderate for days to anthesis (1.3 and 3.7 days, for DSSAT and APSIM, respectively), maturity (4.5 and 3.1 days), and yield (1.1 and 1.2 tons). Deviations of simulated from observed values were low for days to anthesis (DSSAT: -2.4-2.3\%; APSIM: 0-6\%) and days to maturity (DSSAT: -0.6-4.4\%; APSIM: -1.9-3.3\%) but relatively high for yield (DSSAT: -18.5-21.2\%; APSIM: -19.1-37.1\%). Overall the goodness-of-fit measures indicated that models were useful for assessing maize yield at the study site. Simulations for future climate scenarios projected slight increases in the median yield for the near future (1.7\%-2.9\% across models and RCPs), with uncertainty increasing toward mid-century (0.6-4.2\%). By the end of the 21st century, projections ranged between yield decreases by 6.3\% and increases by 4\%. Differences between the RCPs were small, probably due to factor interactions, such as higher temperatures reducing the CO2-induced yield gains for the higher RCP. Uncertainties in studies on the impact of climate change on maize might arise mostly from the choice of crop model and GCM. Therefore, the use of multiple crop models along with multiple GCMs would be advisable in order to adequately consider uncertainties about future climate and crop responses and to provide comprehensive information to policy makers and planners. Overall, results of this study (based on two different crop simulation models across 20 GCMs, and two RCPs under similar crop management) consistently indicated a slight increase in yield.

	abstract = {Sowing date is one of the vital factors for determining crop yield. In this study, temporal and spatial variation of optimal sowing date of summer maize was analyzed by statistical model and the APSIM-Maize model in Henan Province, China. The results showed that average summer maize optimal sowing dates ranged from May 30 to June 13 across Henan Province with earlier sowing before June 8 in the southern part and later sowing from June 4 to June 13 in the northern part. The optimal sowing date in mountain area of western Henan Province should be around May 30. Late maturing variety Nongda 108 should be planted at least two days earlier than middle -maturing variety Danyu 13. Under climate warming background, maize sowing should be postponed for at least 3 days if maize harvesting date could be delayed for a week. It was proposed that sowing should be delayed for about a week for a yearly less precipitation pattern while advanced for about a week for a yearly more precipitation pattern compared to the normal one. Across Henan Province, the optimal sowing dates of summer maize showed no significant change trend in 1971-2010, while the potential sowing period had been extended for some regions, such as south from Zhumadian, Yichuan, Nei-xiang and Nanyang in the middle part of Henan, Linzhou in the northern Henan and Sanmenxia in the western Henan, as a result from advanced maturity of winter wheat due to increasing temperature and winter wheat cultivar change. Optimal sowing dates at 76.7\% of the study stations showed no significant difference between the two methods. It was recommended that the northern Henan should sow maize immediately after any rainfall and replant afterward, while the southern Henan should not sow maize until that there were valid precipitation (3.9 mm and 8.3 mm for upper. south and south parts, respectively) during sowing period, both required enough precipitation during key water requirement period and optimal temperature during grain-filling period.},

	abstract = {There is concern that food insecurity will increase in southern Africa due to climate change. We quantified the response of maize yield to projected climate change and to three key management options - planting date, fertilizer use and cultivar choice - using the crop simulation model, agricultural production systems simulator (APSIM), at two contrasting sites in Zimbabwe. Three climate periods up to 2100 were selected to cover both near- and long-term climates. Future climate data under two radiative forcing scenarios were generated from five global circulation models. The temperature is projected to increase significantly in Zimbabwe by 2100 with no significant change in mean annual total rainfall. When planting before mid-December with a high fertilizer rate, the simulated average grain yield for all three maize cultivars declined by 13\% for the periods 2010-2039 and 2040-2069 and by 20\% for 2070-2099 compared with the baseline climate, under low radiative forcing. Larger declines in yield of up to 32\% were predicted for 2070-2099 with high radiative forcing. Despite differences in annual rainfall, similar trends in yield changes were observed for the two sites studied, Hwedza and Makoni. The yield response to delay in planting was nonlinear. Fertilizer increased yield significantly under both baseline and future climates. The response of maize to mineral nitrogen decreased with progressing climate change, implying a decrease in the optimal fertilizer rate in the future. Our results suggest that in the near future, improved crop and soil fertility management will remain important for enhanced maize yield. Towards the end of the 21st century, however, none of the farm management options tested in the study can avoid large yield losses in southern Africa due to climate change. There is a need to transform the current cropping systems of southern Africa to offset the negative impacts of climate change.},

The wheat cultivar Sujata was used for this simulation study. It was found that there was a negative relationship between grain yield and temperature while there were positive correlations of grain yield with atmospheric CO2 concentration for the region under study. However, the rate of decrease in grain yield was more for higher temperatures rise in contrast to lower temperatures, and the rate of increase in grain and biomass yield was more for higher CO2 concentration compared with the lower levels. On an average, there was 8\% decrease in wheat grain and biomass yield per 1 degrees C increase in temperature. On the contrary, wheat grain yield increased by 33\% and biomass yield by 35\% with the elevation in CO2 concentration from 350 to 850 ppm. Increasing the temperature by1 degrees C and CO2 concentration to 500 ppm, the yield decline in wheat was lower than individual effect of increased temperature. This study showed that environmental factors have significant effects on wheat grain and biomass yield with changes in atmospheric CO2 and temperature.

	doi = {10.1016/j.fcr.2015.09.002},
	abstract = {To increase wheat productivity from current levels, the yield gap, the difference between actual and potential yield, should be analyzed. A crop model was calibrated for three winter wheat cultivars and validated for a major wheat growing area to evaluate yield gaps in Khorasan province in northeastern Iran. The validated model was used to simulate long-term yield for 14 locations under three management conditions (potential, water-limited, nitrogen-limited). The results showed that the average simulated potential yield of 7.8 Mg ha(-1) has not yet been realized by farmers and there is a large gap between the actual and potential production levels (about 5.2 Mg ha(-1)). The simulation showed considerable difference between cultivars for yield gap. When averaged over locations and seasons, the total yield gap obtained for Chamran wheat was 4.4 Mg ha(-1), for Sionz was 6 Mg ha(-1), and for Gascozhen was 6.1 Mg ha(-1). Across locations, the proportion of yield gap from water-limitation was 1.7\% to 19.5\% and for nitrogen- limitation was 40\% to 47\%. The gap caused by other limiting and reducing factors was 33-57\%. The highest yield gap was observed in Ghaen for Gas cozhen (7.6 Mg ha(-1)) and the lowest was observed in Sarakhs for Chamran (3.1 Mg ha(-1)). The results of the study suggest that the average farm yield of about 2.6 Mg ha(-1) in irrigated fields in Khorasan province is not limited by low genetic yield potential. This indicates that farmers should emphasize more on management factors such as water availability, timing of nitrogen application, and selection of cultivars adapted for each environment to reduce yield gap.

	abstract = {Crop phenology is related to the partitioning of assimilates to different organs, crop productivity and timing of crop management. Understanding the uncertainty in simulated crop phenology can help target future direction of model improvement and assess climate change impact more accurately. However, the uncertainty in maize phenology modelling across regions and under climate scenarios has not been properly addressed. This study investigated the uncertainty in simulated maize phenology using six widely used models (SIMCOY, MAIS, Beta, WOFOST, CERES, and APSIM). The models were firstly calibrated and validated using long-term observational data across China's Maize Belt. The validated models were then used to simulate maize phenology changes in response to climate change. The results showed that the six models could reach acceptable precision (NRMSE{\textless} 8\% for all the six models) by the calibration under current climate. However, the uncertainty between models in simulated maize phenology increased with the coefficient of fluctuation from 3.2\% under the baseline to 6.3\% under RCP4.5 and 7.4\% under RCP8.5 in 2030s and 8.9\% under RCP4.5 and 14.5\% under RCP8.5 in 2080s for the simulated silking date, and from 4.2\% under the baseline to 7.0\% under RCP4.5 and 7.7\% under RCP8.5 in 2030s and 10.2\% under RCP4.5 and 16.7\% under RCP8.5 in 2080s for the simulated maturity date in North China Plain. This highlights a significant knowledge gap in understanding how the key physiological processes of maize respond to changing temperature, particularly temperatures beyond the optimum. The uncertainty in predicted phenology is largest for summer maize in North China Plain, smaller for spring maize in northeast and southwest China. The increased uncertainty in North China Plain was due to more frequent supra-optimal temperatures, where different models disagree most in terms of phenology response to temperature, highlighting a key area for future model improvement. This implies that there could be a large uncertainty in simulated maize yield under future climate change in previous modelling studies conducted with a single crop growth model due to the uncertainty in simulated maize phenology.

	abstract = {Characterization of drought environment types (ETs) has proven useful for breeding crops for drought-prone regions. Here, we consider how changes in climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations will affect drought ET frequencies in sorghum and wheat systems of northeast Australia. We also modify APSIM (the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator) to incorporate extreme heat effects on grain number and weight, and then evaluate changes in the occurrence of heat-induced yield losses of more than 10\%, as well as the co-occurrence of drought and heat. More than six million simulations spanning representative locations, soil types, management systems, and 33 climate projections led to three key findings. First, the projected frequency of drought decreased slightly for most climate projections for both sorghum and wheat, but for different reasons. In sorghum, warming exacerbated drought stresses by raising the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit and reducing transpiration efficiency (TE), but an increase in TE due to elevated CO2 more than offset these effects. In wheat, warming reduced drought stress during spring by hastening development through winter and reducing exposure to terminal drought. Elevated CO2 increased TE but also raised radiation-use efficiency and overall growth rates and water use, thereby offsetting much of the drought reduction from warming. Second, adding explicit effects of heat on grain number and grain size often switched projected yield impacts from positive to negative. Finally, although average yield losses associated with drought will remain generally higher than that for heat stress for the next half century, the relative importance of heat is steadily growing. This trend, as well as the likely high degree of genetic variability in heat tolerance, suggests that more emphasis on heat tolerance is warranted in breeding programs. At the same time, work on drought tolerance should continue with an emphasis on drought that co-occurs with extreme heat.},

	abstract = {Climate risk assessment in cropping is generally undertaken in a top-down approach using climate records while critical farmer experience is often not accounted for. In the present study, set in south India, farmer experience of climate risk is integrated in a bottom-up participatory approach with climate data analysis. Crop calendars are used as a boundary object to identify and rank climate and weather risks faced by smallhold farmers. A semi-structured survey was conducted with experienced farmers whose income is predominantly from farming. Interviews were based on a crop calendar to indicate the timing of key weather and climate risks. The simple definition of risk as consequence x likelihood was used to establish the impact on yield as consequence and chance of occurrence in a 10-year period as likelihood. Farmers' risk experience matches well with climate records and risk analysis. Farmers' rankings of 'good' and 'poor' seasons also matched up well with their independently reported yield data. On average, a 'good' season yield was 1.5-1.65 times higher than a 'poor' season. The main risks for paddy rice were excess rains at harvesting and flowering and deficit rains at transplanting. For cotton, farmers identified excess rain at harvest, delayed rains at sowing and excess rain at flowering stages as events that impacted crop yield and quality. The risk assessment elicited from farmers complements climate analysis and provides some indication of thresholds for studies on climate change and seasonal forecasts. The methods and analysis presented in the present study provide an experiential bottom-up perspective and a methodology on farming in a risky rainfed climate. The methods developed in the present study provide a model for end-user engagement by meteorological agencies that strive to better target their climate information delivery.},

We find that shifts in total rainfall amount primarily drive the rainfall-related crop yield change, with less relevance to intraseasonal rainfall features. However, dry regions (total annual rainfall below 500mm/yr) have a high sensitivity to rainfall frequency and intensity, and more intense rainfall events have greater benefits for crop yield than more frequent rainfall. Delayed monsoon onset may negatively impact yields. Our study implies that future changes in seasonal rainfall characteristics should be considered in designing specific crop adaptations in West Africa.},

This study combined process-based modeling and experimental data together to evaluate the effects of different irrigation strategies on crop production and groundwater table change for the past three decades in NCP. Data from a six year field trial (2006-2012) under four irrigation schedules and 28 year (1984-2012) field experiment under full irrigation was used to test the agricultural production systems simulator (APSIM) to simulate the responses of winter wheat and maize to different irrigation management. The results showed that APSIM model could well simulate the grain yield and water consumption of the double cropping system under the changing climate and management practices. Simulation results with four irrigation scenarios (critical stage irrigation (CI), minimum irrigation (MI), rainfed (RF) and full irrigation (FI)) from 1984 to 2012 showed that irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) was highest under CI, although changing from FI would lead to reduction in average annual grain yield by 19.5\%, 33.7\%, and 58.8\% under CI, MI and RF, respectively. Even the minimum irrigation strategy (MI one irrigation for each crop) will result in continuous decline in the groundwater table, implying an inevitable future shift to alternative cropping systems like dryland wheat-maize system, single wheat or maize. Such change will likely result in lower crop productivity and increased inter-annual variability in crop yields, which will demand improved risk management strategies to minimize loss in bad year while maximize return in good years.

However, crop rotations with multiple crops are used in many agricultural regions worldwide. This case-study compares methods to aggregate outputs from simulations of multi-crop systems for climate impact assessments. The APSIM model was used to simulate four crops as monocultures (reinitialised or continuous) or as (single or multiple) instances of continuous rotations. We considered two contrasting climates and two soil types, with four production intensification scenarios (high/low water and nitrogen input). Results suggest that differences among the methods depend on the impact variable of interest and the degree of intensification. Detailed simulations (i.e. multiple runs of continuous rotations) were especially valuable for soil-related variables and limiting growth conditions. These results can indicate sources of uncertainty for large scale impact and adaptation assessments where simplifications of crop rotations are often necessary. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The models did not accurately predict canopy and stalk development through time using growth parameters values developed from observed data, in combination with previously determined RUE for the cultivars. In response to elevated CO2, both predicted higher yields, although AS showed higher sensitivity to CO2 concentration, rainfall and temperature than DC. The Mean of simulations from both models produced better estimations than predictions from either model individually. Thus, applying the two models (in their current form) is likely to give the more accurate predictions than focusing on one model alone. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We designed a method that allowed population models built in DYMEX to interact with APSIM. The simulator engine component of the DYMEX population-modelling platform was wrapped within an APSIM module allowing it to get and set variable values in other APSIM models running in the simulation. A rust model developed in DYMEX is used to demonstrate how the developing rust population reduces the crop's green leaf area. The success of the linking process is seen in the interaction of the two models and how changes in rust population on the crop's leaves feedback to the APSIM crop modifying the growth and development of the crop's leaf area. This linking of population models to simulate pest populations and biophysical models to simulate crop growth and development increases the complexity of the simulation, but provides a tool to investigate biotic constraints within farming systems and further moves APSIM towards being an agro-ecological framework.

	abstract = {The APSIM-Oryza model has been used worldwide to evaluate the impact of diverse management practices on the growth of rice (Oryza sativa L). Despite its importance, the crop productivity (kg ha(-1)) and water productivity (kg ha(-1) mm(-1)) of rice under moisture-limited (i.e. rainfed or rainfed with supplementary alternate wetting-and-drying (AWD) irrigation) farmer-field conditions in tropical South-Asia has received little attention in modelling exercises. Benefits of aligning crop establishment with the onset of rainfall to reduce dependency on supplementary irrigation and improve crop and water productivities have not yet been quantified in Sri Lanka. Therefore, we parameterised and evaluated the APSIM-Oryza model for two widely grown Sri Lankan short- and medium-duration rice varieties. The model estimated the grain yield of rice under moisture-limited farmer-field conditions with a strong fit (n = 24, R-2 {\textgreater} 0.97, RMSE = 484 kg ha(-1)), across cultivation year, season, time of establishment (i.e. with rainfall onset or date-specific planting), variety and/or water management practice (i.e. totally rainfed or rainfed with supplementary irrigation). A climatic analysis indicated that the farmers regularly establish rice crops 2-4 weeks after the rainfall onset. This is a consequence of the current practice of setting the date for crop establishment at pre-season cultivation meetings without a scientifically-validated rainfall forecast. The same analysis revealed that an early onset to the rainy season resulted in longer seasons with more rain than late onset. When the onset of rainfall is delayed, crop modelling scenarios using the validated APSIM model showed an increased dependence on supplementary irrigation for rice cultivation. Alternatively, in years when an early onset was observed, late planting in the season reduced the use of rain water by 95\% while increasing the irrigation water requirement by 11\% compared with planting at rainfall onset. Access to supplementary with AWD irrigation increased the stability of grain yield, and crop and water productivity, irrespective of the onset of rainfall or time of crop establishment.

Availability of irrigation water under projected climate change scenarios is a great concern, and demonstration of the impact of different irrigation regimes on rice, wheat, and system yields is essential to adopt suitable water saving technologies to minimize risk. This study tested the ability of the agricultural production systems simulator (APSIM) model to simulate the effects of different irrigation regimes on yield, irrigation water requirement, and irrigation water productivity (WPi) of rice, wheat, and RW system in upper-gangetic plains of India. The long-term simulated rice yield showed a steadily declining trend at an average rate of 120 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) (R (2) = 0.94, p {\textless} 0.05), while long-term simulated wheat yields showed a lower declining trend at an average rate of 48 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) (R (2) = 0.48, p {\textless} 0.05). The highest WPi of 8.31 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) was observed under RW system with the rice irrigation (IR) regime of 8 days alternate wetting and drying (AWD) and five irrigations for wheat with a yield penalty of 25.5 \%. The next highest WPi was observed in the treatment with a 5-day AWD regime in rice and five irrigations for wheat, with a yield penalty of 20.1 \%. Thus, we can suggest that a 5-day AWD irrigation regime for rice combined with five irrigations during wheat could be the best option under water limiting situations.},

	abstract = {Waterlogging causes apparent reductions in crop yields around the world. Crops undergo plant responses and adaptations due primarily to the reduction in soil oxygen concentrations in the plant root zone that occur during waterlogged conditions. Current methods of assessing and quantifying crop yield reductions due to waterlogging, such as the sum of excess water (SEW) and stress day index (SDI) accumulating methods, and the models DRAINMOD, Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM), and Salt Water And Groundwater MANagement (SWAGMAN) Destiny (Destiny) do not include plant physiological adaptation processes that may limit or avoid reductions in crop yield. This paper analyses results from field trials to create a unifying concept that recognizes the various responses and adaptations of crops to waterlogging. We propose an empirical three stage representation of crop responses and adaptations during waterlogging. Stage one represents increased plant function with unlimited water and adequate soil oxygen concentrations for root respiration for up to 3 d. Stage two follows and represents plant response to declining soil oxygen concentrations oft en resulting in decreased plant function. Finally, stage three represents species dependant plant adaptations. We test the sensitivity of SWAGMAN Destiny using our three stage empirical representation to estimate yield reductions due to waterlogging. Results are consistent with field trial observations, with decreased yield compared to simulations using 10\% air-filled pore space as the waterlogging criteria. We suggest the three stage empirical representation for specific crops can be used to improve simulation model estimations of crop yields due to waterlogging.},

However, to get good output from those models, need to select best models for particular crops and good data source for calibration and validation process. Otherwise outputs of the model do not address the real situation in the field. In this study select three crop models used in rice cropping system and discussed about present data requirement, their application in rice cultivation and model limitations and future potentials. APSIM, ORYZA2000 and DSSAT models were evaluated in this research. However those available models are highly depended on the technical data such as climate, soil, crop and management data and those models do not significantly consider economic and social-cultural factors in agriculture systems. Therefore, simulation results by models do not match with the observed values. Due to this Limitation there is a mandatory requirement to make necessary adjustment or improvements in those models by considering farmers' socio-economic and cultural indicators. In addition, most of the computer models are concentrating in the same crops. When consider the Sri Lankan context, Sir Lanka cultivate comparatively considerable amount of other field crops mainly vegetables with rice where most of these computer models have not been developed to capture the management of vegetables with rice. Hence these limitations in current computer models create an opportunity for researchers to think about new computer models which can capture local conditions and resulting with better model outputs.},

However, little is known about the response of the models to spatially aggregated climate input data and why these responses can differ across models. Depending on the model, regional yield estimates from large-scale simulations may be biased, compared to simulations with high-resolution input data. We evaluated this so-called aggregation effect for 13 crop models for the region of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany. The models were supplied with climate data of 1 km resolution and spatial aggregates of up to 100 km resolution raster. The models were used with 2 crops (winter wheat and silage maize) and 3 production situations (potential, water-limited and nitrogen-water-limited growth) to improve the understanding of errors in model simulations related to data aggregation and possible interactions with the model structure. The most important climate variables identified in determining the model-specific input data aggregation on simulated yields were mainly related to changes in radiation (wheat) and temperature (maize). Additionally, aggregation effects were systematic, regardless of the extent of the effect. Climate input data aggregation changed the mean simulated regional yield by up to 0.2 t ha(-1), whereas simulated yields from single years and models differed considerably, depending on the data aggregation. This implies that large-scale crop yield simulations are robust against climate data aggregation. However, large-scale simulations can be systematically biased when being evaluated at higher temporal or spatial resolution depending on the model and its parameterization.},

	abstract = {Current agriculture depends on a few 'major' species grown as monocultures that are supported by global research and development systems underpinning the current productivity with quantitative evidences. Whereas many hundreds of 'underutilised' crops have no such support systems but knowledge about them is fragmentary and based on the qualitative local evidences of the growers themselves rather than multi-locational research. Farmers in developing parts of the world have traditionally used indigenous knowledge to cope with climate hazards based upon observations and interpretation of natural phenomena. Crop choices, crop mixes and seasonal cropping calendars are largely based on farmer-level local forecasts. Since climate change is characterized mainly by uncertainty, it is vital to assess the crops and system resilience by means of underutilised crops. These neglected crops have the potential to meet real world challenges by means of sustaining humanity, diversifying the agricultural systems and especially responding to climate change with climate-resilient characters. The main analysis engine of the present study involves crop-climate modelling that introduces specific underutilised crops into recognised crop models (APSIM, DSSAT, AquaCrop) and links available climate databases within a geospatial information system framework.

	abstract = {With the aim of increasing peanut production in Australia, the Australian peanut industry has recently considered growing peanuts in rotation with maize at Katherine in the Northern Territory-a location with a semi-arid tropical climate and surplus irrigation capacity. We used the well-validated APSIM model to examine potential agronomic benefits and long-term risks of this strategy under the current and warmer climates of the new region. Yield of the two crops, irrigation requirement, total soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen (N) losses and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were simulated. Sixteen climate stressors were used; these were generated by using global climate models ECHAM5, GFDL2.1, GFDL2.0 and MRIGCM232 with a median sensitivity under two Special Report of Emissions Scenarios over the 2030 and 2050 timeframes plus current climate (baseline) for Katherine. Effects were compared at three levels of irrigation and three levels of N fertiliser applied to maize grown in rotations of wet-season peanut and dry-season maize (WPDM), and wet-season maize and dry-season peanut (WMDP). The climate stressors projected average temperature increases of 1 degrees C to 2.8 degrees C in the dry (baseline 24.4 degrees C) and wet (baseline 29.5 degrees C) seasons for the 2030 and 2050 timeframes, respectively. Increased temperature caused a reduction in yield of both crops in both rotations. However, the overall yield advantage of WPDM increased from 41\% to up to 53\% compared with the industry-preferred sequence of WMDP under the worst climate projection. Increased temperature increased the irrigation requirement by up to 11\% in WPDM, but caused a smaller reduction in total SOC accumulation and smaller increases in N losses and GHG emission compared with WMDP. We conclude that although increased temperature will reduce productivity and total SOC accumulation, and increase N losses and GHG emissions in Katherine or similar northern Australian environments, the WPDM sequence should be preferable over the industry-preferred sequence because of its overall yield and sustainability advantages in warmer climates. Any limitations of irrigation resulting from climate change could, however, limit these advantages.},

	title = {Can short-season grain legumes contribute to more resilient and productive farming systems in semi-arid {Eastern} {Kenya}?},
	volume = {29},
	abstract = {Lately grain legumes have come out of the shadows in research and extension because of their highly valued and multiple benefits for the farmer and the farming systems across the developing world. For semi-arid regions in particular, inadequate and highly variable rainfall and short growing periods limit yield potential and create a risky primary production environment. However, short-season crop varieties offer a promising option for farming with increased uncertainties. Against this background, the aim of this work was to collect field trial data for multiple seasons in Eastern Kenya to better calibrate the existing APSIM (Agricultural Production System sIMulator) legume models for short-season varieties of common bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris L.)., cowpea ( Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) and lablab ( Lablab purpureus (L.) Sweet) and to evaluate the performance of the adapted models in terms of biomass production and yield. Finally with the use of a simulation study, the impact of management options (e.g. sowing time, planting density) and future climate predictions on the overall production potential of the different short-season grain legumes was explored. Results indicate that decisions on optimal sowing times will become more important with shortened growing periods to take full advantage of in-season rainfall. Short-season cultivars of beans were advantageous in extreme short growing periods with external droughts due to their very short maturity time. Lablab seemed to cope best with high in season rainfall variability producing stable yields across a range of rainfall scenarios independent of future climate predictions. Cowpea instead was out yielding beans and lablab in wet years and had a very high biomass production. Consequently, using the full diversity of available short-season legumes can function as an essential part of a sustainable risk management strategy to design more resilient farming systems and increase food security in semi-arid Eastern Kenya. Finally, if well calibrated and tested, simulations models have proved to be an excellent tool for ex-ante assessment of agricultural management interventions in the view of future climate change.},

	abstract = {Spring radiant frosts occurring when wheat is in reproductive developmental stages can result in catastrophic yield lost for producers. Yield potential is also reduced in areas where producers are obliged to sow late to avoid the peak frost risk period. To better understand the spatial and temporal variability of frost events, 0.05° gridded weather datasets were used to calculate frost occurrence and frost impact on wheat production across the Australian wheat belt. Over the last 57 years, no significant trends in frost occurrence were observed in most of the Australian wheat belt. However, more frost events and later last frost days occurred in major parts of production areas while the opposite was rarely observed. Yield impact was simulated at 60 key locations using the Agricultural Production Simulation Model (APSIM) with a newly developed frost module. A significant increase in frost impact on yield was estimated in the higher-elevation areas of south eastern Australia in the states of Victoria and New South Wales. Across Australia, we found that yields could be improved by up to 20\% on average if frost tolerant lines were available. The yield increases resulted from (1) reduced frost damage and (2) the ability to use earlier sowing dates. Simulations suggest that a small reduction in the threshold temperatures, equivalent to frost tolerance of 1°C lower than current cultivars would predicted a large effect on the occurrence of frost damage in the west of Australia. In the east, frost tolerance to lower temperatures ({\textasciitilde}-4°C) would be required to maximise the yield advantage. Thus despite global warming, breeding for improved reproductive frost tolerance remains a high priority for the Australian wheat industry.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.proenv.2015.07.255},
	abstract = {Understanding how climate change is likely to affect crop productivity is essential for global food security. Climate change studies predict an increase in rainfall variability in future decades, which is likely to affect crops grown in water-limited environments. Crop productivity results from complex interactions between genotype, management practices, and the local environment, making it challenging to characterize the crop-level impacts of climate projections. Given the importance of this task for long-term strategies in breeding, farming and policies, and the impracticality of performing sufficient relevant experiments, modeling tools are used to forecast climatic effects. In this study, we used the APSIM-Wheat model (Holzworth et al., 2014) to identify water-stress environment types for 60 representative locations (22 regions) across the Australian wheatbelt (Chenu et al., 2013). Simulations were performed using historical climate records and for a selection of future climate scenarios provided by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Model results indicate substantial changes in water-stressed environments in the coming decades, with projected changes in drought frequency found to be highly region-specific. Regional variations were also dependent on the climate model considered, highlighting a high range of uncertainty for the future projections. In the worst-case climate scenario studied, significant increases in drought conditions, fewer planting opportunities and higher rates of unviable crops were found. By accounting for the complex interactions between crop development and projected future climates, this study provides valuable information on the likely importance of future drought for the wheat industry. These results highlight the urgency for breeding drought-tolerant lines to secure crop productivity in rainfed regions such as Australia.},

	abstract = {A Global crop production is affected by seasonal and climatic variations in temperature, rainfall patterns or intensity and the occurrence of abiotic and biotic stresses. Climate change can alter pest and pathogen populations as well as pathogen complexes that pose an enormous risk to crop yields and future food security. Eyespot disease caused by Oculimacula yallundae and O. acuformis is associated with yield losses in UK wheat estimated in 1998 at {\textless}pounds{\textgreater}24 million. Crop simulation models have been validated as an important tool for the development of more resilient agricultural systems and improved decision making for growers. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) is a software tool that enables sub-models to be incorporated for simulation of production in diverse agricultural systems. APSIM-wheat simulates crop growth and development, soil and management options. Modification of APSIM to incorporate epidemiological disease model for crop growth and yield under different disease intensities has not yet been undertaken in UK or elsewhere. Thus, the objective of this work was to develop epidemiological model for eyespot disease and incorporate it within APSIM for crop simulation under a range of disease and environmental conditions. Historical climatic data combined with 8 years of observed disease (2004-2012) data on incidence and severity of eyespot in UK field trials was used to develop epidemiological model, combining infection and severity, for the prediction of disease development in relation to crop growth stages. Crop growth characteristics, biomass and yield were measured separately and employed for eyespot yield loss or biomass reduction model in wheat based on disease severity. Current work is focused on modifying APSIM to simulate crop loss through the incorporation of the epidemiological disease and yield reduction components and further validation to confirm that empirical data were accurately simulated.},

	abstract = {Since sowing date of maize is sensitive to climate variability and changes, it is critical to examine how sowing dates affect maize yields in various temperature regimes in the southwestern US. In doing so, the ApsimRegions model, regionally extended version of the APSIM model, has been run over the southwestern US region at 32 km resolutions over the 21-year period from 1991 to 2011. The meteorological forcing dataset was North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) and irrigation was assumed to be applied at a 95\% soil water-holding capacity. The interannually-fixed and -variant sowing date runs (fixed and optimal run, respectively) showed 50-300\% increases of the yield potential over selected regions by optimizing sowing date. For the optimal run, it was found that earlier sowing dates are favorable for higher yields primarily by increasing the length of growing season in cold mountainous regions. In these regions, warmer than normal conditions in the sowing period tend to advance the sowing date, resulting in yield increases. Over the low-elevation warm regions (e.g., the southern parts of the Central Valley and Arizona), yields are less correlated with sowing dates and the length of growing season, perhaps because growing season temperatures are high enough for fast growth. Instead, in those warm regions, maize yields are sensitive to temperature variations during the sowing and late growing season due to the adverse effects of extremely high temperature events on maize development. These results indicate that appropriate adaptations for sowing date can enhance yield significantly, but the positive effect of advanced sowing on the maize yields in warmer spring is constrained in the cool environmental regions rather than the warm environmental regions in the southwestern US.},

	abstract = {Agricultural productivity is strongly dependent on local climate conditions determined by meteorological parameters thus assessing the potential impact of the climate change and variability on regional agricultural systems has become crucial. To ensure food security, it is required to find under performing regions to investments and assess yields change in high-performing regions in coming decades under climate change and variability. In this study, we investigate the response of maize yield potential (Yp) on climate change scenario using Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) crop model over the Southwestern U.S. (SWUS) region. APSIM's modules are essentially point-based models representing the system at a single point in space. We develop automated modeling framework (ApsimRegions, 2013), which allows the APSIM to be run over a large domain with about a thousand points over the study area. Using 21-year period (1991-2011) of North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data, we perform sensitivity test of the maize Yp to assess the relative contribution of climate variables, by adding standard deviation of the climatological values. The results show that maximum and minimum temperature greatly contribute to the variation of maize yields over the SWUS on the interannual time scale, depending on geographical locations with varied local climates. In order to access data of present and future climate, we have completed high-resolution regional climate simulation by dynamically downscaling general circulation model results (GFDL-ESM2 M) using regional climate models (WRF and OLAM). In this study, 20 years of integration period is selected in both historical period (1981-2000) and future period (2031-2050). The potential maize yields in the future period under the RCP8.5 greenhouse gas concentrations pathways show that the yields are significantly changed comparing to the historical period. In the generally rising temperature regime, the projected Yp shows strong geospatial variations according to the regional climate characteristics.},

	abstract = {Computer-based crop simulation models (CSMs) are well entrenched as tools for a wide variety of research, development and extension applications. Despite this, critics remain and there are perceptions that CSMs have not contributed to impacts on-farm or in the research community, particularly with plant breeding. This study reviewed the literature, interviewed 45 stakeholders (modellers, institutional representatives and clients of modelling), and analysed the industry-funded project portfolio to ascertain the current state of use of CSMs in the grains industry in Australia, including scientific progress, impacts and development needs. We found that CSMs in Australia are widely used, with similar to 100 active and independent users, similar to 15 model developers, and at any one time similar to 10 postgraduate students, chiefly across six public research institutions. The dominant platform used is APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator). It is widely used in the agronomic domain. Several cases were documented where CSM use had a demonstrable impact on farm and research practice. The updating of both plant and soil process routines in the models has slowed and even stalled in recent years, and scientific limitations to future use were identified: the soil-plant nitrogen cycle, root growth and function, soil surface water and residue dynamics, impact of temperature extremes on plant function, and up-to-date cultivar parameter sets. There was a widespread appreciation of and optimism for the potential of CSMs to assist with plant-breeding activities, such as environmental characterisation, trait assessment, and design of plant-breeding programs. However, we found little evidence of models or model output being used by plant breeders in Australia, despite significant impacts that have emerged recently in larger international breeding programs. Closer cooperation between geneticists, physiologists and breeders will allow gene-based approaches to characterise and parameterise cultivars in CSMs, demonstrated by recent progress with phenology in wheat. This will give models the ability to deal with a wider range of potential genotypexenvironmentxmanagement scenarios.},

	volume = {31},
	abstract = {Maize planting in northern region of China plays a vital role in the crop production in China, and it occupies a large proportion in total grain production and planting area in China. Meanwhile, northern region of China is prone to drought and the drought normalization happens in this area seriously, which restricts the steady development of maize. The data used in this paper included daily weather data of 217 meteorological stations in the 14 provinces (municipalities, or autonomous regions) in northern region of China from 1961 to 2010 and crop, soil, field management data of spring maize. Based on the total precipitation during the growing season of spring maize we divided the study area into 6 precipitation zones (I-VI) with the interval of 100 mm, and then analyzed the effects of drought of different grades occurring in main growing stage on grain yield of spring maize in northern region of China by using the crop water deficit index as the agricultural drought index and the agriculture production systems simulator (APSIM) as the research method. The results showed that the yield reduction of spring maize caused by drought in northern region of China had a decreasing trend from west to east, and the precipitation distribution led to the differences of damage degree in each area directly. The precipitation during growing season of spring maize in Zone I located in western region (including Xinjiang, western Inner Mongolia and northern Gansu) was below 100 mm, and the natural precipitation couldn't meet the need of growth and development of spring maize, so the drought risk of planting spring maize under rainfed conditions in western oasis irrigated agricultural area was great, and it needed to energetically develop water-efficient irrigation in this area. While the precipitation during growing season of spring maize in Zone VI located in southeastern region (including Southern Jilin, eastern Liaoning, southern Henan and southern Shaanxi) was above 500 mm, and the natural precipitation could meet the requirements of spring maize growth and development basically, so production in eastern rainfed agricultural area would be less affected by drought, and it was difficult to reflect the influence of drought grade difference on production accurately. In addition, the ratio of the station with yield reduction had a decreasing trend with the increasing of yield loss degree; from jointing to tasselling stage, the yield reduction in northern region of China was between 0 and 50\%, and there were 37.3\% of stations with the yield reduction of between 0 and 10\%, and only 4.1\% of stations with the yield reduction of between 40\% and 50\%. Drought happening from jointing to tasselling stage of spring maize will cause serious influence on grain yield, and the yield reduction in this stage is higher than that from tasselling to maturity stage. Besides, the discrete degree of yield reduction in this stage is also higher than that from tasselling to maturity stage. The influence degree of drought of each grade on crop production is different; from jointing to tasselling stage, the interquartile ranges of yield reduction caused by drought are extreme drought (20.1\%-33.6\%), severe drought (12.0\%-20.3\%), moderate drought (6.3\%-15.2\%) and light drought (4.7\%-11.6\%), respectively.},

We explore in this study the potential changes in spring wheat yields at Swift Current and Melfort, Canada, for different sowing windows under projected climate scenarios ( i.e., the representative concentration pathways, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). First, the APSIM model was calibrated and evaluated at the study sites using data from long term experimental field plots. Then, the impacts of change in sowing dates on final yield were assessed over the 2030-2099 period with a 1990-2009 baseline period of observed yield data, assuming that other crop management practices remained unchanged. Results showed that the performance of APSIM was quite satisfactory with an index of agreement of 0.80, R 2 of 0.54, and mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 529 kg/ha and 1023 kg/ha, respectively (MAE=476 kg/ha and RMSE=684 kg/ha in calibration phase). Under the projected climate conditions, a general trend in yield loss was observed regardless of the sowing window, with a range from -24\% to -94\% depending on the site and the RCP, and noticeable losses during the 2060s and beyond (increasing CO 2 effects being excluded). Smallest yield losses obtained through earlier possible sowing date ( i.e., mid-April) under the projected future climate suggested that this option might be explored for mitigating possible adverse impacts of climate variability. Our findings could therefore serve as a basis for using APSIM as a decision support tool for adaptation/mitigation options under potential climate variability within Western Canada.},

	abstract = {Soil carbon (C) models are important tools for understanding soil C balance and projecting C stocks in terrestrial ecosystems, particularly under global change. The initialization and/or parameterization of soil C models can vary among studies even when the same model and data set are used, causing potential uncertainties in projections. Although a few studies have assessed such uncertainties, it is yet unclear what these uncertainties are correlated with and how they change across varying environmental and management conditions. Here, applying a process-based biogeochemical model to 90 individual field experiments (ranging from 5 to 82 years of experimental duration) across the Australian cereal-growing regions, we demonstrated that welldesigned optimization procedures enabled the model to accurately simulate changes in measured C stocks, but did not guarantee convergent forward projections (100 years). Major causes of the projection uncertainty were due to insufficient understanding of how microbial processes and soil C pool change to modulate C turnover. For a given site, the uncertainty significantly increased with the magnitude of future C input and years of the projection. Across sites, the uncertainty correlated positively with temperature but negatively with rainfall. On average, a 331\% uncertainty in projected C sequestration ability can be inferred in Australian agricultural soils. This uncertainty would increase further if projections were made for future warming and drying conditions. Future improvement in soil C modelling should focus on how the microbial community and its C use efficiency change in response to environmental changes, and better conceptualization of heterogeneous soil C pools and the C transformation among those pools.},

	abstract = {Recent expansion of cropping into Australia’s high-rainfall zone (HRZ) has involved dual-purpose crops suited to long growing seasons that produce both forage and grain. Early adoption of dual-purpose cropping involved cereals; however, dual-purpose canola (Brassica napus) can provide grazing and grain and a break crop for cereals and grass-based pastures. Grain yield and grazing potential of canola (up until bud-visible stage) were simulated, using APSIM, for four canola cultivars at 13 locations across Australia’s HRZ over 50 years. The influence of sowing date (2-weekly sowing dates from early March to late June), nitrogen (N) availability at sowing (50, 150 and 250 kg N/ha), and crop density (20, 40, 60, 80 plants/m2) on forage and grain production was explored in a factorial combination with the four canola cultivars. The cultivars represented winter, winter × spring intermediate, slow spring, and fast spring cultivars, which differed in response to vernalisation and photoperiod. Overall, there was significant potential for dual-purpose use of winter and winter × spring cultivars in all regions across Australia’s HRZ. Mean simulated potential yields exceeded 4.0 t/ha at most locations, with highest mean simulated grain yields (4.5–5.0 t/ha) in southern Victoria and lower yields (3.3–4.0 t/ha) in central and northern New South Wales. Winter cultivars sown early (March–mid-April) provided most forage ({\textgreater}2000 dry sheep equivalent (DSE) grazing days/ha) at most locations because of the extended vegetative stage linked to the high vernalisation requirement. At locations with Mediterranean climates, the low frequency ({\textless}30\% of years) of early sowing opportunities before mid-April limited the utility of winter cultivars. Winter × spring cultivars (not yet commercially available), which have an intermediate phenology, had a longer, more reliable sowing window, high grazing potential (up to 1800 DSE-days/ha) and high grain-yield potential. Spring cultivars provided less, but had commercially useful grazing opportunities (300–700 DSE-days/ha) and similar yields to early-sown cultivars. Significant unrealised potential for dual-purpose canola crops of winter × spring and slow spring cultivars was suggested in the south-west of Western Australia, on the Northern Tablelands and Slopes of New South Wales and in southern Queensland. The simulations emphasised the importance of early sowing, adequate N supply and sowing density to maximise grazing potential from dual-purpose crops.},

	abstract = {High-input agriculture in China has successfully increased crop productivity in the past decades, but at a significant environmental cost. It is essential to improve management strategies to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other environmental costs, while maintaining grain yields. However, there is a lack of studies to evaluate mitigation strategies under long-term climate variability. This paper combines field experimental data and soil-plant systems modeling to investigate the potential for improving water and nitrogen management of a wheat-maize double cropping system in North China Plain. The APSIM model was calibrated against the data and then applied to simulate crop yield and N2O emissions from soil in response to irrigation and nitrogen inputs. Our results show that the N fertilizer rate and irrigation amount under the local farmer practice could be reduced by 28\% and 14\% without sacrificing crop yield. This in turn led to a reduction in GHG emissions by 31\%, mainly attributed to the decrease in emissions from the production and transportation of N fertilizer and direct N2O emissions from soil. Additionally, the results indicate that the direct N2O emissions from soil was positively correlated with N inputs, implying an increasing emission factor (N2O produced per unit of N input) with N application rates. It is concluded that potential exists to optimize N fertilizer rate and irrigation amount to reduce GHG emissions while still maintaining crop yield in the agro-ecosystems in North China Plain.

	doi = {10.1016/j.agsy.2016.03.008},
	abstract = {Smallholder farmers in Malawi must cope with small farm size, low soil fertility and production risks associated with rainfed agriculture. Integration of legumes into maize-based cropping systems is advocated as a means to increase production of diverse nutrient-dense grains and improve soil fertility. It is difficult to achieve both aims simultaneously, however. Short-duration grain legumes rarely produce enough biomass to appreciatively improve soils, and long duration pigeonpea, commonly grown in Malawi as a dual purpose crop, produces little or no edible grain as a consequence of grain-filling into the dry season. A novel technology is the doubled-up legume rotation (DLR) system in which two legumes with complementary phenology are intercropped and grown in rotation with maize. Initial performance from on-farm research is favorable; however, it is crucial to understand competition for resources in mixed cropping systems under variable soil and climate conditions. We used soil and crop yield data from farmer participatory trials to parameterize the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) and evaluate its performance in simulating observed treatments at three locations in central Malawi. We used the calibrated APSIM model to investigate the performance of DLR and other maize-based systems across 26 growing seasons (1979-2005) in the three agroecologies. We simulated two DLR systems (maize rotated with a groundnut/pigeonpea or soybean/pigeonpea intercrop), maize rotated with groundnut or soybean, maize intercropped with pigeonpea, and continuous maize under a range of N fertilizer inputs. We extended findings to the household level by determining calorie and protein yields of these systems, and calculating the chance that an average household could meet their food requirements by dedicating all available farmland to a given system. Simulated maize grain yields in DLR and maize-grain legume rotations were essentially equivalent, and exceeded yields in maize/pigeonpea intercrop and sole cropped maize receiving comparable fertility inputs. All rotation systems were more likely to meet household calorie and protein needs than other systems receiving equivalent inputs. DLR systems accumulated higher total soil C and N over time than traditional rotation systems in areas where pigeonpea performed well. However, the effects of improved soil fertility on maize yields were counterbalanced by factors including N immobilization and water availability. We conclude that where growing conditions allow, DLR can harness the complementary phenology of pigeonpea to build soil quality for the future without reducing maize yields or compromising household food production in the immediate term.

	abstract = {Loess Plateau of China is an area with serious soil evaporation and large inter-annual rainfall variations. Water stress is the major limiting factor for crop production in local area. Optimizing plant density is one crucial management in semi-arid dry land areas where crop growth is constrained by precipitation and a high evaporative demand. The Agricultural Production System Simulator (APSIM) was parameterized and tested with two years datasets, and then used to investigate long-term rainfed maize productivity and water balance with the historical weather records. Model application showed that water use and yield were varied because of the plant density and the inter-annual variability of precipitation. Plant density presented no influence on the evapotranspiration (ET) in extremely dry years, dry years and mild wet years but a significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) influence in normal and extremely wet years. In extremely dry years, the grain yield and (WUE) were all significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) decreased when plant density increased. The grain yield and WUE showed a parabolic relation with the plant density except extremely dry years. On average, the maximum yield and WUE were 6715 kg ha(-1) and 1.81 kg m(-3) at 52500 plants ha(-1) (D-2) in dry years, 7857 kg ha(-1) and 1.92 kg m(-3) at 67500 plants ha(-1) (D-3) in normal years, 8937 kg ha(-1) and 2.19 kg m(-3) at 67500 plants ha(-1) (D-3) in mild wet years, and 9713 kg ha(-1) at 82500 plants ha(-1) (D-4) and 2.25 kg m(-3) at 67500 plants ha(-1) (D-3) in extremely wet years, respectively. However, no significant difference was obtained for average yield or WUE when compared traditional density of 52500 plants ha(-1) (D-2) with higher plant density. Compared with the traditional plant density of 52500 plants ha(-1) (D-2), the increase of plant density significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) reduced soil evaporation, only with the exception of extremely dry years. In order to get long term average benefits in the study area and similar agro-ecological zones, plant populations should not exceed 32500 plants ha(-1) (D-1) in extremely dry years, indeed, lower may be better. A plant density of 52500 plants ha(-1) (D-2) in dry years and 67500 plants ha(-1) (D-3) in normal years, mild wet years and extremely wet years are recommended as the optimum value, respectively.

	doi = {10.1016/j.fcr.2016.04.013},
	abstract = {Saline soils are a major challenge in the cropping region of Inner Mongolia, China. Crop modelling might be a useful tool for identifying suitable management practices for sunflower, which is the main crop in this area. To evaluate the applicability of the sunflower model within the Agricultural Production System siMulator (APSIM) for saline soils, the model was calibrated using one year of field trial data and tested with another year of data collected at the Yichang Experimental Station in the Hetao Irrigation District, Inner Mongolia, China. The treatments employed in the trials included different salinity levels and nitrogen application rates. The crop characteristics assessed included the seed yield (SY), dry matter (DM), and leaf area index (LAI) at various growth stages of the sunflowers. To represent salinity effects in the model, i.e., reduced water uptake by the plants, we tested three options by modifying the crop lower limit (CLL), the water-extraction coefficient (KL), and the pattern of root exploration in the soil profile (XF). We optimized each parameter individually against measured SY, DM, and LAI values using a multi-objective calibration in the PEST program with data collected from a field trial that was conducted in 2012. The results indicated that by modifying CLL, IC, and XF in the SoilWater module of APSIM, sunflower SY and DM could be simulated for saline soils, and modifying la afforded the most accurate SY simulation (R-2 = 0.99, RMSE = 253.51 kg ha(-1), RRMSE = 7.11\%). Additionally, the scale factors used to modify CLL, KL, and XF (noted as SCLL, SKL, and SXF, respectively) according to the referenced CLL, KL, and XF values could be estimated based on the 0-20-cm soil salinity level before sowing (S). Specifically, SCLL increased linearly with S (SCLLS model, R-2 = 0.80), and SKL and SXF decreased linearly with the natural logarithm of S (SKLS and SXFS models, R-2 = 0.74 and 0.67, respectively). When using measured data from 2014 for the evaluation, the SKLS and SXFS models achieved high accuracy for the SY simulations (R-2 = 0.71 and 0.71; RMSE = 568.7 and 845.5 kg ha(-1), RRMSE = 17.03\% and 25.32\%, respectively) and acceptable accuracy for the DM simulations (R-2 = 0.41 and 0.45; RMSE = 2543.2 and 3114.5 kg ha(-1), RRMSE = 20.99\% and 25.70\%, respectively), although the SCLLS model slightly underestimated SY and DM. Further research is required to elucidate the mechanism linking CLL, KL, XF, crop physiological parameters (e.g., radiation use efficiency), and soil salinity by testing the approaches at additional sites; such efforts would improve the accuracy of sunflower growth modelling in salinized areas.

	doi = {10.1093/jxb/erw093},
	abstract = {The capture of subsoil water by wheat roots can make a valuable contribution to grain yield on deep soils. More extensive root systems can capture more water, but leave the soil in a drier state, potentially limiting water availability to subsequent crops. To evaluate the importance of these legacy effects, a long-term simulation analysis at eight sites in the semi-arid environment of Australia compared the yield of standard wheat cultivars with cultivars that were (i) modified to have root systems which extract more water at depth and/or (ii) sown earlier to increase the duration of the vegetative period and hence rooting depth. We compared simulations with and without annual resetting of soil water to investigate the legacy effects of drier subsoils related to modified root systems. Simulated mean yield benefits from modified root systems declined from 0.1-0.6 t ha(-1) when annually reset, to 0-0.2 t ha(-1) in the continuous simulation due to a legacy of drier soils (mean 0-32mm) at subsequent crop sowing. For continuous simulations, predicted yield benefits of {\textgreater}0.2 t ha(-1) from more extensive root systems were rare (3-10\% of years) at sites with shallow soils ({\textless}1.0 m), but occurred in 14-44\% of years at sites with deeper soils (1.6-2.5 m). Earlier sowing had a larger impact than modified root systems on water uptake (14-31 vs 2-17mm) and mean yield increase (up to 0.7 vs 0-0.2 t ha(-1)) and the benefits occurred on deep and shallow soils and in more years (9-79 vs 3-44\%). Increasing the proportion of crops in the sequence which dry the subsoil extensively has implications for the farming system productivity, and the crop sequence must be managed tactically to optimize overall system benefits.},

We found that the precision gains of StrRS varied considerably across stratification methods and crop models. Precision gains for compact geographical stratification were positive, stable and consistent across crop models. Stratification with soil water holding capacity had very high precision gains for twelve models, but resulted in negative gains for two models. Increasing the sample size monotonously decreased the sampling errors for all the sampling schemes. We conclude that compact geographical stratification can modestly but consistently improve the precision in estimating regional mean yields. Using the most influential environmental variable for stratification can notably improve the sampling precision, especially when the sensitivity behavior of a crop model is known.

	abstract = {Foreknowledge about sugarcane crop size can help industry members make more informed decisions. There exists many different combinations of climate variables, seasonal climate prediction indices, and crop model outputs that could prove useful in explaining sugarcane crop size. A data mining method like random forests can cope with generating a prediction model when the search space of predictor variables is large. Research that has investigated the accuracy of random forests to explain annual variation in sugarcane productivity and the suitability of predictor variables generated from crop models coupled with observed climate and seasonal climate prediction indices is limited. Simulated biomass from the APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator) sugarcane crop model, seasonal climate prediction indices and observed rainfall, maximum and minimum temperature, and radiation were supplied as inputs to a random forest classifier and a random forest regression model to explain annual variation in regional sugarcane yields at Tully, in northeastern Australia. Prediction models were generated on 1 September in the year before harvest, and then on 1 January and 1 March in the year of harvest, which typically runs from June to November. Our results indicated that in 86.36 \% of years, it was possible to determine as early as September in the year before harvest if production would be above the median. This accuracy improved to 95.45 \% by January in the year of harvest. The R-squared of the random forest regression model gradually improved from 66.76 to 79.21 \% from September in the year before harvest through to March in the same year of harvest. All three sets of variables-(i) simulated biomass indices, (ii) observed climate, and (iii) seasonal climate prediction indices-were typically featured in the models at various stages. Better crop predictions allows farmers to improve their nitrogen management to meet the demands of the new crop, mill managers could better plan the mill's labor requirements and maintenance scheduling activities, and marketers can more confidently manage the forward sale and storage of the crop. Hence, accurate yield forecasts can improve industry sustainability by delivering better environmental and economic outcomes.},

The review of literature pertaining to soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics within Australian grain farming systems does not enable us to conclude on the best farming practices to increase or maintain SOC for a specific combination of soil and climate. This study aimed to further explore the complex interactions of soil, climate, and farming practices on SOC. We undertook a modeling study with the Agricultural Production Systems slMulator modeling framework, by combining contrasting Australian soils, climates, and farming practices (crop rotations, and management within rotations, such as fertilization, tillage, and residue management) in a factorial design. This design resulted in the transposition of contrasting soils and climates in our simulations, giving soil climate combinations that do not occur in the study area to help provide insights into the importance of the climate constraints on SOC. We statistically analyzed the model's outputs to determinate the relative contributions of soil parameters, climate, and farming practices on SOC. The initial SOC content had the largest impact on the value of SOC, followed by the climate and the fertilization practices. These factors explained 66, 18, and 15\% of SOC variations, respectively, after 80 years of constant farming practices in the simulation. Tillage and stubble management had the lowest impacts on SOC. This study highlighted the possible negative impact on SOC of a chickpea phase in a wheat chickpea rotation and the potential positive impact of a cover crop in a subtropical climate (OLD. Australia) on SOC. It also showed the complexities in managing to achieve increased SOC, while simultaneously aiming to minimize nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and nitrate leaching in farming systems. The transposition of contrasting soils and climates in our simulations revealed the importance of the climate constraints on SOC.},

	abstract = {As climate change could significantly influence crop phenology and subsequent crop yield, adaptation is a critical mitigation process of the vulnerability of crop growth and production to climate change. Thus, to ensure crop production and food security, there is the need for research on the natural (shifts in crop growth periods) and artificial (shifts in crop cultivars) modes of crop adaptation to climate change. In this study, field observations in 18 stations in North China Plain (NCP) are used in combination with Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM)-Maize model to analyze the trends in summer maize phenology in relation to climate change and cultivar shift in 1981-2008. Apparent warming in most of the investigated stations causes early flowering and maturity and consequently shortens reproductive growth stage. However, APSIM-Maize model run for four representative stations suggests that cultivar shift delays maturity and thereby prolongs reproductive growth (flowering to maturity) stage by 2.4-3.7 day per decade (d 10a(-1)). The study suggests a gradual adaptation of maize production process to ongoing climate change in NCP via shifts in high thermal cultivars and phenological processes. It is concluded that cultivation of maize cultivars with longer growth periods and higher thermal requirements could mitigate the negative effects of warming climate on crop production and food security in the NCP study area and beyond.},

We found that change in sowing/transplanting date did not significantly affect rice and wheat yield in RWRS, although alleviated the negative impact of climate change to some extent. From 1981 to 2009, climate change jointly caused rice and wheat yield change by -17.4 to 1.5 \%, of which increase in temperature reduced yield by 0.0-5.8 \% and decrease in solar radiation reduced it by 1.5-8.7 \%.

We applied a manual method to calibrate APSIM-Wheat and CERES-Wheat for the flowering day, maturity day, leaf area index, biomass and grain yield of five spring wheat cultivars under rainfed conditions in Pakistan. Five wheat cultivars of diverse origin namely Tatara, NARC-2009, Sehar-2006, SKD-1 and F-Sarhad were planted on 19th November, at Islamabad during the years 2007-2011. The experiments were laid out in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) replicated four times with individual plot size of 5 m x 3 m. APSIM-Wheat and CERES-Wheat were calibrated for all five wheat cultivars using genetic coefficients estimated based upon measured data during 2008-09 cropping year and validated with independent data sets (experimental data of 2009-10 and 2010-11 cropping seasons) which were not used for models calibration. Both models were able to accurately simulate anthesis and maturity days, maximum leaf area index, biomass and grain yield, with normalized root mean square error (RMSE) less than 10\%, D-index greater than 0.80 and model efficiency above 80\% in most cases. The temporal changes in maximum LAI accumulation for all cultivars indicate that both measured and simulated values match each other. Evaluation with the measured data showed that performance of both models was realistic as indicated by the accurate simulation of crop phenology, LAI, biomass and grain yield against measured data. Climate variability results depicted that an increase in temperature from 0 degrees C to 5 degrees C resulted in a 60\% average decline in the yield of wheat cultivars while increased CO2 increased yield similar to the combined effect of increased temperature and CO2. We concluded that to bring accuracy in the simulation outcomes of models, new cultivars should be calibrated to minimize uncertainty to allow judicious recommendations in response to climate variability.

	abstract = {Intercropping can improve crop productivity through increased water use efficiency (WUE). However, limited information exists to support its adoption and subsequent management. In such instances, crop models can be used as decision support tools to complement data from field trials. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator Model (APSIM) was used to develop best management practices for improved yield and WUE for a sorghum-cowpea intercrop system for 5 sites in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: Richards Bay, Umbumbulu, Deepdale, Wartburg and Ukulinga. Each site represented 1 of 5 different bio-resource units. Planting dates (trigger season climate method, modelling and fixed date approaches), fertilizer rates (0, 50 and 100\% recommended N rate), plant population (50\% less and 50\% more, for either sorghum or cowpea) and irrigation (deficit irrigation and rainfall-based approaches) were considered. In Deepdale, planting dates generated by the model gave high (952.285 and 326.368 kg.ha -1) and stable yields for sorghum and cowpea, respectively. Adding 100\% fertilizer improved both yield and WUE of the intercrop by 18.5 and 5.1\%, respectively, in Umbumbulu and Wartburg. Across all environments, sorghum and cowpea plant populations of 39 000 and 13 000 plants.ha -1, respectively, increased yield (26.11\%) and WUE (15.54\%) of the intercrop system. Deficit irrigation was more effective resulting in yield (12.84\%) and WUE (11.09\%) improvements. It is concluded that APSIM can be used to develop best management practices to assist in developing guidelines for improving productivity of intercrop systems under water-scarce conditions.},

In this contribution, an assessment of front-rotor trailing-edge blowing is presented for the reduction of contra-rotating open-rotor interaction noise. For this purpose, the German Aerospace Center designed a generic contra-rotating open rotor that has been modified to include trailing-edge blowing at the front rotor blades. With the German Aerospace Center computational fluid dynamics code TAU, unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations have been made of the baseline and the trailing-edge blowing configuration. Subsequently, an aeroacoustic analysis has been performed with the Ffowcs-Williams/Hawkings tool APSIM+ for both configurations. The results show negligible differences of the aerodynamic performance, with significantly lower unsteady loading of the aft rotor when the trailing-edge blowing technique is active. The aeroacoustic results illustrate that the interaction tones are notably ameliorated; that is, a reduction over almost the complete polar angle is seen when trailing-edge blowing is active. With respect to the A-weighted overall sound pressure level, a reduction of approximately 2.5 dBA in the maximum level for the trailing-edge blowing configuration is achieved for the considered geometry. Noise reductions up to 5 dBA are displayed in the up-and downstream directions, which mainly arise from reduced interaction tones caused by the trailing-edge blowing technique. The decreased noise radiation with trailing-edge blowing mainly stems from a reduction in the first two interaction tones.},

Therefore, it is important to quantify the impacts of agronomic factors, including soil physical properties, cultivar selections, and management practices on yield gaps of maize under the changing climate in NEC in order to provide reliable recommendations to narrow down the yield gaps. In this study, the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM)-Maize model was used to separate the contributions of soil physical properties, cultivar selections, and management practices to maize yield gaps. The results indicate that approximately 5\%, 12\%, and 18\% of potential yield loss of maize is attributable to soil physical properties, cultivar selection, and management practices. Simulation analyses showed that potential ascensions of yield of maize by improving soil physical properties PAY(s), changing to cultivar with longer maturity PAY(c), and improving management practices PAY(m) for the entire region were 0.6, 1.5, and 2.2 ton ha(-1) or 9\%, 23\%, and 34\% increases, respectively, in NEC. In addition, PAY(c) and PAY(m) varied considerably from location to location (0.4 to 2.2 and 0.9 to 4.5 ton ha(-1) respectively), which may be associated with the spatial variation of growing season temperature and precipitation among climate zones in NEC.

	doi = {10.1071/CP15267},
	abstract = {The canola (Brassica napus L.) module in the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) was developed in the late 1990s. There has been no peer-reviewed account of the scientific underpinnings of the module, despite considerable testing across a wide range of environments in the Australian grains industry and numerous applications of the model to address agronomic and crop adaptation issues. This paper presents a summary of the parameters in the module and reviews the physiological evidence justifying their values and module performance, and reflects on areas of module improvement and application. APSIM-Canola simulates crop development, growth, yield and nitrogen (N) accumulation in response to temperature, photoperiod, radiation, soil water and N supply, with a daily time-step, using well-accepted approaches. The module has been validated on more than 250 data points across Australia, China, and Germany and typical root mean squared deviations for days to flowering are similar to 5 days and for grain yield are similar to 0.4tha(-1). Testing on vernalisation-responsive winter types and in high yielding situations has indicated that more research is required to define phenology parameters and yield forming processes in high yielding environments. There is a need to develop better predictive routines for grain oil content that take account of the dynamics of grain filling and interactions with environmental conditions, and improve upon current regression-type approaches. Further testing of N responses is required. Physiological characterisation of new cultivar types, such as hybrids, Indian mustard (Brassica juncea), and new herbicide tolerance types is required to make the module more applicable to contemporary canola production systems. A lack of understanding of the effects of high and low temperature extremes on reproductive processes is currently limiting the use of the module outside conventional sowing dates and agro-climatic zones.},

	volume = {67},
	doi = {10.1071/CP15282},
	abstract = {Optimising the sowing date of canola (Brassica napus L.) in specific environments is an important determinant of yield worldwide. In eastern Australia, late April to early May has traditionally been considered the optimum sowing window for spring canola, with significant reduction in yield and oil in later sown crops. Recent and projected changes in climate, new vigorous hybrids, and improved fallow management and seeding equipment have stimulated a re-evaluation of early-April sowing to capture physiological advantages of greater biomass production and earlier flowering under contemporary conditions. Early-mid-April sowing generated the highest or equal highest yield and oil content in eight of nine field experiments conducted from 2002 to 2012 in south-eastern Australia. Declines in seed yield (-6.0\% to -6.5\%), oil content (-0.5\% to -1.5\%) and water-use efficiency (-3.8\% to -5.5\%) per week delay in sowing after early April reflected levels reported in previous studies with sowings from late April. Interactions with cultivar phenology were evident at some sites depending on seasonal conditions. There was no consistent difference in performance between hybrid and non-hybrid cultivars at the earliest sowing dates. Despite low temperatures thought to damage early pods at some sites ({\textless}-2 degrees C), frost damage did not significantly compromise the yield of the early-sown crops, presumably because of greater impact of heat and water-stress in the later sown crops. A validated APSIM-Canola simulation study using 50 years of weather data at selected sites predicted highest potential yields from early-April sowing. However, the application of a frost-heat sensitivity index to account for impacts of temperature stress during the reproductive phase predicted lower yields and higher yield variability from early-April sowing. The frost-heat-limited yields predicted optimum sowing times of mid-April at southern sites, and late April to early May at the northern sites with lower median yield and higher yield variability in crops sown in early April. The experimental and simulation data are potentially compatible given that the experiments occurred during the decade of the Millennium drought in south-eastern Australia (2002-10), with dry and hot spring conditions favouring earlier sowing. However, the study reveals the need for more accurate and validated prediction of the frost and heat impacts on field-grown canola if simulation models are to provide more accurate prediction of attainable yield as new combinations of cultivar and sowing dates are explored.},

	abstract = {Even though, there is a general understanding on the impact of climate change and variability on agricultural crops, the spatial and temporal variability of these impacts remains yet uncertain. Thus, modeling the likely impact of climate change on cereal crops at local level is crucial for developing possible future options of adaptation and mitigation strategies. This research was conducted with the objective of modeling the impact of climate change and variability on sorghum production. Hence, calibration and evaluation of agricultural production system simulator (APSIM) model was conducted using four years research data (2006 to 2009) and its performance was assessed using coefficient of determination (r 2), root mean square error (RMSE) and index of agreement (d). According to the HadGEM 2-ES model, an increase of maximum (5.9°C) and minimum (6.4°C) temperature was revealed in the end term (2080s) over the base year. Similarly precipitation was predicted to increase by 27\% in the end term while almost constant for the other periods. The monthly accumulated heat unit was increased in all periods and this has shortened the maturity date of sorghum by about a week compared to the historical. Keeping the current sowing window (April) and other management activities the same, future Sorghum yield has simulated to decrease between 5\% and 24\%. Using both the historical and predicted climate data, sowing on March followed by April has shown a reasonable yield advantage in both RCPs. The response of the different sorghum cultivars to the future climate changes should further be studied for deciding which cultivar could give a better yield for the future under different management options.},

	volume = {26},
	abstract = {Sowing date is one of the vital factors for determining crop yield. In this study, temporal and spatial variation of optimal sowing date of summer maize was analyzed by statistical model and the APSIM-Maize model in Henan Province, China. The results showed that average summer maize optimal sowing dates ranged from May 30 to June 13 across Henan Province with earlier sowing before June 8 in the southern part and later sowing from June 4 to June 13 in the northern part. The optimal sowing date in mountain area of western Henan Province should be around May 30. Late-maturing variety Nongda 108 should be planted at least two days earlier than middle-maturing variety Danyu 13. Under climate warming background, maize sowing should be postponed for at least 3 days if maize harvesting date could be delayed for a week. It was proposed that sowing should be delayed for about a week for a yearly less precipitation pattern while advanced for about a week for a yearly more precipitation pattern compared to the normal one. Across Henan Province, the optimal sowing dates of summer maize showed no significant change trend in 1971-2010, while the potential sowing period had been extended for some regions, such as south from Zhumadian, Yichuan, Nei-xiang and Nanyang in the middle part of Henan, Linzhou in the northern Henan and Sanmenxia in the western Henan, as a result from advanced maturity of winter wheat due to increasing temperature and winter wheat cultivar change. Optimal sowing dates at 76.7\% of the study stations showed no significant difference between the two methods. It was recommended that the northern Henan should sow maize immediately after any rainfall and replant afterward, while the southern Henan should not sow maize until that there were valid precipitation (3.9 mm and 8.3 mm for upper south and south parts, respectively) during sowing period, both required enough precipitation during key water requirement period and optimal temperature during grain-filling period.},

The building of a common database (DB) structure demands a harmonization process aimed at standardising concepts, language and data in order to make them clear, and has to produce a well-documented and easily available tool for the whole scientific community. The Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) has made a great effort in this sense, improving the vocabulary developed by the International Consortium for Agricultural Systems Applications (ICASA) and defining harmonization procedures. Nowadays, these ones have also to be addressed to facilitate the extraction of input files for crop model simulations. Substantially, two alternative directions can be pursued: adapting data to models, building a standard storage structure and using translators that convert DB information to model input files; or adapting models to data, using the same storage structure for feeding modelling solutions constituted by combining model components, re-implemented in the same model platform.

The ICFAR information management system simplifies data entry, improves model input extraction (implementing System Dynamics ontology), and satisfies both the paradigms. This has required the development of different software tools: ICFAR-DB for data entry and storage; a model input extractor for feeding the crop models (MoLInEx); SEMoLa platform for building modelling solutions and performing via scripts the model intercomparison. The use of the standard AgMIP/ICASA nomenclature in the ICFAR-DB and the opportunity to create files with MoLInex for feeding AgMIP model translators allow full system interoperability.},

	shorttitle = {Test-driven {Development}},
	abstract = {Clean code that works--now. This is the seeming contradiction that lies behind much of the pain of programming. Test-driven development replies to this contradiction with a paradox--test the program before you write it. A new idea? Not at all. Since the dawn of computing, programmers have been specifying the inputs and outputs before programming precisely. Test-driven development takes this age-old idea, mixes it with modern languages and programming environments, and cooks up a tasty stew guaranteed to satisfy your appetite for clean code that works--now. Developers face complex programming challenges every day, yet they are not always readily prepared to determine the best solution. More often than not, such difficult projects generate a great deal of stress and bad code. To garner the strength and courage needed to surmount seemingly Herculean tasks, programmers should look to test-driven development (TDD), a proven set of techniques that encourage simple designs and test suites that inspire confidence. By driving development with automated tests and then eliminating duplication, any developer can write reliable, bug-free code no matter what its level of complexity. Moreover, TDD encourages programmers to learn quickly, communicate more clearly, and seek out constructive feedback. Readers will learn to: Solve complicated tasks, beginning with the simple and proceeding to the more complex. Write automated tests before coding. Grow a design organically by refactoring to add design decisions one at a time. Create tests for more complicated logic, including reflection and exceptions. Use patterns to decide what tests to write. Create tests using xUnit, the architecture at the heart of many programmer-oriented testing tools. This book follows two TDD projects from start to finish, illustrating techniques programmers can use to easily and dramatically increase the quality of their work. The examples are followed by references to the featured TDD patterns and refactorings. With its emphasis on agile methods and fast development strategies, "Test-Driven Development" is sure to inspire readers to embrace these under-utilized but powerful techniques.  0321146530B10172002},

	abstract = {Model frameworks have represented a substantial step forward with respect to monolithic implementations of biophysical models. However, the diffusion of such frameworks, as model development environment, beyond the groups developing them has been very modest. The reusability of models has also proved to be modest. The reason for the latter was attributed also to the lack of standardization toward few frameworks. Emphasis has been placed on the framework and even new implementations of models have been made targeting a specific framework, likely assuming that the reusability of the model unit would have been directly proportional to the quality of the framework. In any case, the goal of several projects has been to make available the framework. Developers in the operational arena, but even in research, have reacted by developing their own framework. Still, the problem of model reuse has been largely unsolved; estimating that increasing the flexibility for reuse would have added a costly overhead, in terms of both complexity and possibly as lack of efficiency in the operational use. The focus on frameworks has made software architects overlooking on the requirements of reusability per se of model units. The component oriented programming paradigm allows targeting intrinsic reusability of discrete model units, and makes room for enabling advances functionalities in simulation systems. This paper firstly present the abstract architecture of a component oriented framework articulated in independent layers: Model, Composition, and Configuration. The Application layer may link to any of these, to develop from simple console applications to sophisticated MVC applications. Proofs of concept are presented for each layer, including the BioMA framework of the European Commission used for agriculture and climate change studies.},

We performed a literature review with the aim of improving our understanding of model integration process, and also presenting better strategies for building integrated modeling systems. We identified five different phases to characterize integration process: pre-integration assessment, preparation of models for integration, orchestration of models during simulation, data interoperability, and testing. Commonly, there is little reuse of existing frameworks beyond the development teams and not much sharing of science components across frameworks. We believe this must change to enable researchers and assessors to form complex workflows that leverage the current environmental science available. In this paper, we characterize the model integration process and compare integration practices of different groups. We highlight key strategies, features, standards, and practices that can be employed by developers to increase reuse and interoperability of science software components and systems.},

	abstract = {For decision makers in the domains of agriculture and environment, for instance in government agencies, farmers, environmental NGOs and farmers' unions, it is beneficial to evaluate ex-post or to asses ex-ante the impacts of their choices. To research these interdisciplinary relationships, models developed by different scientific disciplines and often operating at different scales can be integrated into model chains that cover processes across disciplines. In order to assemble models into an operational model chain conceptual, semantic and technical levels of integration have to be taken into account.

The main focus of this paper is on technical integration to ensure repeatability and reproducibility of model chain runs and to optimize use of computer hardware for model simulations. Technical integration itself can be achieved by different approaches (i.e. manual, scripting, building or using a proprietary framework, using an open framework based on standards). From the many available modelling frameworks (e.g. OMS, TIME, KEPLER, FRAMES, MODCOM, OpenMI) the emphasis will be on OpenMI, the Open Modelling Interface and its use and usefulness as a readily available, generally accepted and open standards based framework.

OpenMI is an open source software standard for dynamically linking models at runtime, which can potentially be used in many domains, but is currently mainly applied in the water and environmental domains. This paper describes and evaluates the use of OpenMI in several multi-disciplinary large projects that worked on integrated models. These projects operated in the disciplines of agriculture, land use, nitrogen cycling, forestry, hydrology and economics.

To this end two workshops were organized to acquire feedback from both software developers and modellers that contributed to the aforementioned projects on the use of OpenMI. Perceived advantages and disadvantages of OpenMI differed between modellers and software engineers, although both identified the lack of standard functionality as a major disadvantage and the prescription of a way of working through OpenMI as a standard as a major advantage. In conclusion, OpenMI can be used as a standard for technical model integration across disciplines, and it is not limited to one particular discipline.},

The simulator engine component of the DYMEX population-modelling platform was wrapped within an APSIM module allowing it to get and set variable values in other APSIM models running in the simulation. A rust model developed in DYMEX is used to demonstrate how the developing rust population reduces the crop's green leaf area. The success of the linking process is seen in the interaction of the two models and how changes in rust population on the crop's leaves feedback to the APSIM crop modifying the growth and development of the crop's leaf area. This linking of population models to simulate pest populations and biophysical models to simulate crop growth and development increases the complexity of the simulation, but provides a tool to investigate biotic constraints within farming systems and further moves APSIM towards being an agro-ecological framework.},

However, opportunities exist to capture more water and use it more effectively that involve judicious management of prior crops and fallows (e.g. crop sequence, weed control, residue management). The dry-land wheat production system of southern Australia, augmented by simulation studies, is used to demonstrate the relative impacts and interactions of a range of pre-crop and in-crop management decisions on water productivity. A specific case study reveals how a novel genetic trait, long coleoptiles that enable deeper sowing, can interact with different management options to increase the water-limited yield of wheat from 1.6 t ha−1 to 4.5 t ha−1, reflecting the experience of leading growers. Understanding such interactions will be necessary to capture benefits from new varieties within the farming systems of the future.},

	abstract = {Increased subsoil water extraction by wheat roots enhanced through management or breeding can increase yield, but the benefits depend on the seasonal pattern of water availability as influenced by rainfall distribution, soil type and management. We used a well validated crop simulation model to assess the wheat yield benefits arising from 20\% faster root descent and/or more effective water extraction in the subsoil (\&gt;0.6 m) under different management scenarios. The analysis was conducted in Mediterranean, temperate equi-seasonal and subtropical Australian wheat-growing environments on deep sand, loam and deep clay soils, respectively.

Overall mean yield benefits of 0.3–0.4 t ha−1 were predicted from the combination of faster descent and more efficient roots at all sites and yield reductions were rare, although considerable seasonal and site variation in yield benefits was evident (range in benefits −0.1 to 1.4 t ha−1). In general, faster root descent provided less separate benefit to water uptake and yield (up to 9 mm and 0.1 t ha−1) than more efficient subsoil extraction (up to 21 mm and 0.3 t ha−1), especially for optimal sowing dates, although late-sown crops on deep sands were an exception. At all sites, the yield impacts of preceding management (0.5 to 1.8 t ha−1) and sowing date (0.1 to 0.9 t ha−1) were more consistent and often exceeded or overrode those of root modification by influencing the depth of profile wetting and duration of root descent. For example there was little benefit (\&lt;0.1 t ha−1) of modified roots following lucerne compared to an annual crop at most sites as the soils rewet below 1 m less frequently. The study provides insights for targeting those environments and management scenarios for which the largest yield benefits will arise from investments to improve wheat root systems.},

More extensive root systems can capture more water, but leave the soil in a drier state, potentially limiting water availability to subsequent crops. To evaluate the importance of these legacy effects, a long-term simulation analysis at eight sites in the semi-arid environment of Australia compared the yield of standard wheat cultivars with cultivars that were (i) modified to have root systems which extract more water at depth and/or (ii) sown earlier to increase the duration of the vegetative period and hence rooting depth. We compared simulations with and without annual resetting of soil water to investigate the legacy effects of drier subsoils related to modified root systems. Simulated mean yield benefits from modified root systems declined from 0.1–0.6 t ha−1 when annually reset, to 0–0.2 t ha−1 in the continuous simulation due to a legacy of drier soils (mean 0–32mm) at subsequent crop sowing. For continuous simulations, predicted yield benefits of {\textgreater}0.2 t ha−1 from more extensive root systems were rare (3–10\% of years) at sites with shallow soils ({\textless}1.0 m), but occurred in 14–44\% of years at sites with deeper soils (1.6–2.5 m). Earlier sowing had a larger impact than modified root systems on water uptake (14–31 vs 2–17mm) and mean yield increase (up to 0.7 vs 0–0.2 t ha−1) and the benefits occurred on deep and shallow soils and in more years (9–79 vs 3–44\%). Increasing the proportion of crops in the sequence which dry the subsoil extensively has implications for the farming system productivity, and the crop sequence must be managed tactically to optimize overall system benefits.},

	abstract = {Genotype-environment interactions (GEI) limit genetic gain for complex traits such as tolerance to drought. Characterization of the crop environment is an important step in understanding GEI. A modelling approach is proposed here to characterize broadly (large geographic area, long-term period) and locally (field experiment) drought-related environmental stresses, which enables breeders to analyse their experimental trials with regard to the broad population of environments that they target. Water-deficit patterns experienced by wheat crops were determined for drought-prone north-eastern Australia, using the APSIM crop model to account for the interactions of crops with their environment (e.g. feedback of plant growth on water depletion). Simulations based on more than 100 years of historical climate data were conducted for representative locations, soils, and management systems, for a check cultivar, Hartog. The three main environment types identified differed in their patterns of simulated water stress around flowering and during grain-filling. Over the entire region, the terminal drought-stress pattern was most common (50\% of production environments) followed by a flowering stress (24\%), although the frequencies of occurrence of the three types varied greatly across regions, years, and management. This environment classification was applied to 16 trials relevant to late stages testing of a breeding programme. The incorporation of the independently-determined environment types in a statistical analysis assisted interpretation of the GEI for yield among the 18 representative genotypes by reducing the relative effect of GEI compared with genotypic variance, and helped to identify opportunities to improve breeding and germplasm-testing strategies for this region. © 2010 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Closing the gap between yields currently achieved on farms and those that can be achieved with best practice and current technology in a given environment is a key strategy for increasing grain production on existing cropland. In this study, the yield gap of rainfed wheat in Australia was derived by a data rich (DR) analysis method made possible by the high density of data available in the Australian grain zone. At the national scale, the analysis revealed that Australia’s 15 year (1996–2010) average actual wheat yield (Ya) was 1.7 t/ha, while the simulated water-limited yield potential (Yw) was 3.5 t/ha; thus the yield gap (Yg = Yw-Ya) was 1.8 t/ha; and the relative yield (Y\% = 100 x Ya/Yw) was 49\%. The fifteen year average Ya and Yw values for each of the 245 statistical local areas (SLAs) in Australia’s wheat zone were strongly and positively correlated (Ya = 0.456 x Yw + 0.15; R2 = 0.65; RMSE = 0.291; p \&lt; 0.001) such that the yield gap (Yw-Ya) tended to be larger in SLAs with higher Yw values. Mean Y\% values vary among SLAs from a low of 34\% to a high of 69\% (standard deviation = 7.7\%). The extremely tight correlation, at the national scale (Ya = 0.488 x Yw + 0.021; R2 = 0.95; RMSE = 0.087; p \&lt; 0.001), between the methodologically independent estimates of Yw and Ya values points to the consistency of both estimates. It also indicates the potential for using updated Yw estimates to help derive more reliable national crop yield forecasts in real time. The results of this analysis were compared with those of two alternative analyses of Australia’s wheat yield gaps using (1) EarthStat, a statistically based global yield gap analysis methodology and (2) the Global Yield Gap Atlas (GYGA) designed to achieve locally credible assessments of yield gaps for developing regions such as sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and South Asia (SA) with the limited data typically available in such countries. At the national level all three methods gave similar results. However, at the sub-national level (based on agroecological zones) differences emerged between the water-limited yield potential values of EarthStat on the one hand and those of the DR and GYGA methods on the other. Given the high spatial environmental variability within the Australian wheat zone the remarkable level of agreement between results from these two methodologies provides evidence of the robustness of the GYGA protocols. The advantage of the DR method is in its higher resolution and the subsequent local relevance of results.},

The model has 10 parameters that capture the diversity of biochar types, 15 parameters that address biochar-soil interactions and 4 constants. The range of values and their sensitivity is reported. The biochar model was connected to APSIM's maize and wheat crop models to investigate long-term (30 years) biochar effects on US maize and Australia wheat in various soils. Results from this sensitivity analysis showed that the effect of biochar was the largest in a sandy soil (Australian wheat) and the smallest in clay loam soil (US maize). On average across cropping systems and soils the order of sensitivity and the magnitude of the response of biochar to various soil-plant processes was (from high to low): SOC (11\% to 86\%) {\textgreater} N2O emissions (−10\% to 43\%43\%) {\textgreater} plant available water content (0.6\% to 12.9\%) {\textgreater} BD (−6.5\% to −1.7\%) {\textgreater} pH (−0.8\% to 6.3\%) {\textgreater} net N mineralization (−19\% to 10\%) {\textgreater} CO2 emissions (−2.0\% to 4.3\%) {\textgreater} water filled pore space (−3.7\% to 3.4\%) {\textgreater} grain yield (−3.3\% to 1.8\%) {\textgreater} biomass (−1.6\% to 1.4\%). Our analysis showed that biochar has a larger impact on environmental outcomes rather than agricultural production. The mechanistic model has the potential to optimize biochar application strategies to enhance environmental and agronomic outcomes but more work is needed to fill knowledge gaps identified in this work.},

	abstract = {Biochar applications have been shown to increase crop yields on acidic and low activity soils in the tropics but fewer positive yield responses have been reported for temperate soils. We hypothesized that even without a yield response, applying biochar to a Midwestern Mollisol could improve soil quality and plant nutrient availability because of the carbon it supplies and its conditioning effect. Eighteen small field plots (23.7 m2) on a glacial-till derived soil were established by incorporating 0 to 96 Mg ha− 1 of hardwood biochar to a depth of 30 cm. Several soil quality indicators, plant nutrient availability, uptake, and yield of two consecutive maize (Zea mays L.) crops were monitored. Biochar application significantly increased soil pH, readily available water (RAW) content (defined as volumetric water available between − 10 kPa and − 100 kPa) and soil organic C (SOC). It decreased bulk density (BD), but had no consistent effect on soil infiltration rates, CEC, or nutrient uptake. Biochar application did increase grain yield during the first year by 11 to 55\% following very high stover application rates (3.5 × the typical amount), presumably because biochar mitigated adverse effects of allelochemicals released from the decomposing maize residue. There was no detectable biochar effect on maize yield during the second year when the crop was limited by severe drought.},

Root die-back during the two weeks following ratoon harvest was estimated to be 0.15 kg m-2, about 17\% of the total root mass. Root die-back after the plant cane harvest was lower because fire was not used at this harvest and soil humidity was higher under the accumulated litter. A small amount of fine roots proliferated in the litter layer, amounting to 1\% of the total mass and 3\% of the total length. Root turnover could not be accurately assessed from minirhizotron observations due to variation in the relationship between coring data and the minirhizotron data with both time and soil depth.},

The high rainfall variability and limited planting opportunities in these regions make crop production risky. A robust crop simulation model can assist farmer decision-making via simulation analyses to quantify production risks. Accordingly, we developed a simple, yet mechanistic crop simulation model for sorghum for use in assessing climatic risk to production in water-limited environments. The model simulates grain yield, biomass accumulation, crop leaf area, phenology and soil water balance. The model uses a daily time-step and readily available weather and soil information and assumes no nutrient limitation. The model was tested on numerous data (n=38) from experiments spanning a broad range of environments in the semi-arid tropics and subtropics. Potential limitations in the model were identified and examined in a novel testing procedure by using combinations of predicted and observed data in various modules of the model. The model performed satisfactorily, accounting for 94\% and 64\% of the variation in total biomass and grain yield, respectively. The difference in outcome for biomass and yield was caused by limitations in predicting harvest index. The concepts involved, and the limitations encountered, developing a crop model to be simple but consistent with the biophysical rigour required for application to such a diverse range of environments, are discussed.},

A better understanding of factors affecting canopy development may allow farmers to develop more efficient planting and harvest schedules as well providing a basis for cultivar improvement. Two Natal cultivars (NCo376 and N12) were grown without irrigation on a sandy clay soil and were ratooned at least once on eight occasions at 2-month intervals. The base temperature for leaf appearance was determined as 10°C by regressing leaf numbers against thermal time and by comparing leaf extension rate and air temperature. A base temperature of 16°C was established for tiller appearance. Peak stalk density occurred approximately 500°C day after ratooning. Leaf senescence was correlated with leaf appearance and with soil water content. Tiller senescence occurred after the canopy closed beyond 70\% interception of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Final leaf area increased linearly up to about 400 and 420 cm2 for leaf 16 of NCo376 and N12, respectively. Area did not increase much after leaf 16 and was reduced when soil water content was low. The phyllochron interval was 109 and 118°C day up to leaf 14 and was 169 and 200°C day thereafter for NCo376 and N12, respectively. Measurements indicated that annual radiation was intercepted most efficiently by crops ratooned in February and least efficiently by crops ratooned in April.},

The demand for water, often identified with a potential transpiration rate, is defined in terms of a maximum crop growth rate multiplied by the conservative ratio of transpiration to dry-matter production. From experimental evidence, supported by theory, this ratio is proportional to the mean saturation vapour-pressure deficit. As hypothesized, the root front accelerates during seedling establishment to keep demand and supply in balance. Once a maximum root velocity is reached (ca. 2-4 cm d\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) transpiration is limited by water supply, except when the soil behind the root front is wetted by rain or irrigation, when it is limited by demand. Irrigation amounts and timing can both be estimated from this scheme.},

	abstract = {There is little detailed information on yield accumulation in sugarcane under high-input conditions, which can be used to quantify the key physiological parameters contributing to yield variation. Sugarcane is grown under plant and ratoon crop conditions. This study analysed canopy development, radiation interception and biomass accumulation of two contrasting cultivars of sugarcane under irrigation during the same season under plant and ratoon crop conditions. Over the 15 month season, 11 crop samplings were conducted. Biomass partitioning to stalk was also measured to determine to what extent differences in partitioning between cultivars under ratoon and plant crop conditions contribute to differential productivity. The key findings were: (1) The ratoon crop accumulated biomass more quickly than the plant crop during the first 100 days of growth due to higher stalk number, faster canopy development and greater radiation interception. For similar reasons, cultivar Q138 had higher early biomass production than cultivar Q117 in the plant crop. (2) Early differences in biomass accumulation due to crop class became negligible at about 220 days because maximum RUE of the plant crop (1.72 ± 0.01 g MJ−1) was 8\% higher than in the first ratoon crop (1.59 ± 0.08 g MJ−1). The higher maximum RUE in the plant crop was consistent with a higher crop growth rate (35.1 ± 2.3 versus 31.0 ± 3.4 g m−2 d−1) during the linear phase of biomass accumulation. (3) Biomass accumulation, which ceased about 300 days after planting/ratooning and 140 days before final harvest, attained similar levels of 53–58 t ha−1 in all four crops. (4) The plateau in biomass was associated with loss of live millable stalks, and not a cessation in the growth rate of individual stalks. The crops continued to intercept radiation while on the biomass plateau, so that average RUEs at final harvest were much lower than the maximum values. (5) There was no effect of crop class or cultivar on the fraction of biomass in the leaf and millable stalk components. This study emphasizes that maximising early radiation interception and biomass accumulation will not necessarily lead to higher yield in an environment where biomass production reaches a plateau well before final harvest. Loss of live millable stalks late in the crop cycle results in poor utilisation of intercepted radiation.},

	abstract = {Sugarcane is harvested commercially at ages varying from 9 to 36 months. Since high N supply can decrease the sucrose concentration in fresh millable stalks and consequently decrease the commercial value of the stalks, the opportunity exists to manipulate N supply (both from fertiliser and that mineralised from soil organic matter) to maximise economic return at different times of harvest. Accordingly, this study describes how N supply the time-course of sucrose accumulation in sugarcane and determines yield both on a dry weight basis (as commonly analysed by crop physiologists) and on a fresh weight basis (which is how cane is paid for commercially). Data on crop N uptake and its efficiency of utilisation are also presented. There was a trade-off between maximising sucrose yield and sucrose concentration in fresh millable stalks with different N supply and this varied with time of harvest. Sucrose concentration in fresh millable stalks, particularly during early growth, was maximised by low N supply. The lower sucrose concentration (on a fresh weight basis) with high N supply could be largely explained by a decrease in stalk dry matter content. Most of the variation in stalk sucrose yield could be explained by variation in stalk biomass irrespective of N supply. Whilst increasing N supply decreased the sucrose concentration in dry millable stalks, this effect was relatively small compared to the large positive effect of N supply on stalk biomass. It is concluded that N has a marked effect on stalk dry matter content, and hence a greater effect on the commercial measures (yield and sucrose concentration of fresh millable stalks) of sugarcane production than on the physiological measures (stalk biomass and sucrose concentration on a dry weight basis) of crop performance.},

	abstract = {APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator) is a software system which provides a flexible structure for the simulation of climatic and soil management effects on growth of crops in farming systems and changes in the soil resource. The focus of this paper is the predictive performance of APSIM for simulation of soil water and nitrate nitrogen in contrasting soils (vertisols and alfisols) and environments. The three APSIM modules that determine the dynamics of water, carbon, and nitrogen in the soil system (viz. SOILWAT, SOILN and RESIDUE v.1) are described in terms of the processes represented, with particular emphasis on aspects of their coding that differ from their precursors in CERES and PERFECT. The most fundamental change is in SOILN, which now provides a formal balance of both carbon and nitrogen in the soil and includes a labile soil organic matter pool that decomposes more rapidly than the bulk of the soil organic matter. Model performance, in terms of prediction of soil water and nitrate, is evaluated during fallows, thereby avoiding complications arising from water use and nitrogen uptake by a crop. One data set is from a long-term experiment on a vertisol in southeast Queensland which studied two tillage treatments (conventional and zero tillage) in combination with fertiliser nitrogen inputs for the growth of wheat; soil water and nitrate were measured twice each year (pre-planting and post-harvest). The second comes from experiments at Katherine, Northern Territory, where legume leys growing on alfisols were chemically killed and ensuing changes in soil water and nitrate were measured during a single season. For both datasets, the predictive ability of the model was satisfactory for water and nitrate, in terms of both the total amounts in the whole profile and their distribution with depth. Since neither of these datasets included measurements of the runoff component of the water balance, this aspect of model performance was evaluated, and shown to be generally good, using data from a third source where runoff had been measured from contour bay catchments.},

	abstract = {A simple, phenomenological model was developed to describe the carbon, nitrogen, and water budgets of a soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) crop from emergence to maturity. Daily meteorological data input to the model were minimum temperature, maximum temperature, solar radiation, and precipitation. Leaves were grown to give a linear function of mean daily temperature. From the calculated leaf area index the daily intercepted solar radiation by the crop was determined. Daily carbon accumulation was calculated as a linear function of intercepted radiation. The daily nitrogen accumulation rate was calculated as a linear function of vegetative biomass. Leaf growth, carbon accumulation and symbiotic-nitrogen fixation rates were all made sensitive to the amount of soil water. Experimental data were collected to develop the empirical relationships between these three physiological processes and the amount of transpirable soil water. These data showed nitrogen fixation rates to be more sensitive to soil dehydration than either leaf growth or leaf gas exchange. Preliminary tests showed that model predictions compared favorably with field observations. An analysis of the model's behavior showed that crop yield was most sensitive to those variables influencing the interception of solar radiation and its conversion to biomass.},

abstract = {Effects of N in crops are profound, but much understanding of crop growth responses to N is empirical. This review attempts to develop a mechanistic understanding of the effects of N on crop biomass accumulation by elucidating quantitative relationships among leaf N content, CO2 assimilation rate, and crop radiation use efficiency. Three crop species were considered: soybean (Glycine max [L.] Men.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), and maize (Zea mays L.). The correlation between leaf N content and leaf CO2 assimilation rates was high within each species, although the response functions were markedly different among species. A relationship was developed predicting crop radiation use efficiency (biomass accumulated per unit solar radiation intercepted) for each of the crops as a function of both leaf CO2 assimilation rate and leaf N content. Radiation use efficiency within each species was nearly constant at high leaf CO2 assimilation rates, but decreased appreciably at low leaf CO2 assimilation rates. At the leaf CO2 assimilation rates typical of a species, the radiation use efficiency was predicted to be about 1.2 g MJ-1 for soybean, 1.4 g MJ-1 for rice, and 1.7 g MJ-1 for maize. Simple calculations during early crop growth examined the competitive use of N for the construction of either large leaf area or high leaf N content. Maize had the greatest biomass accumulation because it had low leaf N contents that allowed the most crop leaf area growth, and it had high radiation use efficiencies. For each rate of N supply to leaves, an optimum leaf N content existed to maximize crop biomass accumulation.},

Merr.] physiological characterization in a maximum yield environment may identify yield-optimization factors, lead to reassessment of fundamental crop model parameters, and provide guidance for management or breeding efforts. From 2011 to 2013, we characterized biomass and N accumulation rates, radiation use efficiency (RUE), and yield for four or five cultivars in a maximum-yield contest field. Grain yield among cultivars ranged from 5290 to 7953 kg ha-1. The highest yields were observed in 2013, when biomass and N accumulation rates ranged from 45.6 to 64.3 g m-2 d-1 and 1.43 to 2.08 g N m-2 d-1, respectively, and when RUE values ranged from 1.46 to 1.89 g MJ-1. The observed crop growth characteristics in 2013 were near or above the maximum values previously reported in the literature. These empirical measurements provide collateral data documenting a soybean crop with grain yields approximately 6719 kg ha-1.},

The methodology and the tool were successfully applied to estimate phenological parameters for 40 soybean cultivars covering maturity groups from 00 to 6. Our approach utilized information on flowering, physiological maturity and soybean maturity group, and provided a complete set of phenological parameters for APSIM that accounted also for temperature × photoperiod interactions throughout the crop cycle. The model predicted flowering (root mean square error, RMSE = 3.1 d) and physiological maturity (RMSE = 5.5 d) very well in a range of environments across the USA (33–46°N latitude, n = 280). The relative absolute error was below 3% in all cases indicating the robustness of our approach. The APSIM PLANT phenology module is generic, thus our approach can be applied to all the short-day species included in the modelling platform."

Crop data include main developmental stages, leaf area index (LAI), above ground biomass, grain yield and grain number of 72 soybean cultivars in China. We derived the parameters controlling soybean ?owering and maturity time in the lack of data from contrasting environments, then tested APSIM to simulate LAI, biomass and grain yield. Our results show that once phenology is correctly simulated, APSIM was able to capture the LAI and biomass growth dynamics of multiple cultivars and across different years. Our data showed a strong correlation of grain yield with grain number, but not with grain size. Future model improvement could include the simulation of grain setting (grain number and grain filling rate) and their difference between cultivars so that yield difference can be simulated. Further scenario modelling demonstrated that APSIM also captured the genotype by environment interactions as they impact on yield. The derived parameters for 72 soybean cultivars provide the first data set in APSIM for improved modelling of soybean genotypes in China and beyond, adding to the current APSIM validation database of soybean. This also formed the basis for future modelling of intercropping systems with soybean, e.g. maize/soybean intercropping."

abstract = {Abstract We used the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to predict and explain maize and soybean yields, phenology, and soil water and nitrogen (N) dynamics during the growing season in Iowa, USA. Historical, current and forecasted weather data were used to drive simulations, which were released in public four weeks after planting. In this paper, we (1) describe the methodology used to perform forecasts; (2) evaluate model prediction accuracy against data collected from 10 locations over four years; and (3) identify inputs that are key in forecasting yields and soil N dynamics. We found that the predicted median yield at planting was a very good indicator of end-of-season yields (relative root mean square error [RRMSE] of ~20\%). For reference, the prediction at maturity, when all the weather was known, had a RRMSE of 14\%. The good prediction at planting time was explained by the existence of shallow water tables, which decreased model sensitivity to unknown summer precipitation by 50-64\%. Model initial conditions and management information accounted for one-fourth of the variation in maize yield. End of season model evaluations indicated that the model simulated well crop phenology (R2 = 0.88), root depth (R2 = 0.83), biomass production (R2 = 0.93), grain yield (R2 = 0.90), plant N uptake (R2 = 0.87), soil moisture (R2 = 0.42), soil temperature (R2 = 0.93), soil nitrate (R2 = 0.77), and water table depth (R2 = 0.41). We concluded that model set-up by the user (e.g. inclusion of water table), initial conditions, and early season measurements are very important for accurate predictions of soil water, N and crop yields in this environment.},

abstract = {Abstract A biophysically robust crop simulation model can assist industry planning and farmer decision-making via simulation analyses to quantify production potential and production risks. Accordingly, we developed a simple, yet mechanistic peanut simulation model for use in assessing climatic risks to production potential for both irrigated and dryland conditions. The model simulates pod yield, biomass accumulation, crop leaf area, phenology, and soil water balance and is suitable for application over a diverse range of production environments. The model uses a daily time step, utilizes readily available weather and soil information, and assumes no nutrient limitations. The model was tested on numerous data from experiments spanning a broad range of environments in the tropics and subtropics. The model performed satisfactorily, accounting for 89\% of the variation in pod yield on data sets derived from independent experiments, which included crops yielding from 1 to 71 t ha-1. Limitations of the model and aspects requiring better understanding to improve quantification are discussed. Despite some limitations, the model attains a useful degree of predictive skill for a broad range of situations and environments. This outcome is testimony to the utility of the simple, generic framework used as the basis for this model. The model is suitable for simulation studies aimed at assisting industry planning and farmer decision-making.},

abstract = {A chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) growth and development model (chikpgro) has been developed from the hedgerowversion of the groundnut model pnutgro. Changes were made in various subroutines determining vegetative and reproductive development, crop growth and partitioning of assimilates to component plant organs to simulate chickpea crop growth under water-limiting and nonlimiting situations. Using the experimental data of the 1984 and 1986 seasons, the model was calibrated for cultivar-specific parameters of cvs. Annigeri and JG 74 and also for soil parameters determining water balance of the root-zone. The model was validated against data from the 1985, 1987, 1992 and 1993 seasons. The model predicted flowering, pod initiation, beginning of seed growth and physiological maturity within ± 5 days of the observed values, except under extreme wet situations when the actual seed growth and physiological maturity of chickpea occurred later than the simulated dates. Leaf area index, total dry matter production (TDM) and its partitioning to various plant organs under irrigated and water-stressed conditions were also predicted satisfactorily by the model. Soil moisture changes in the rooting-zone of chickpea were also predicted accurately. Predicted TDM and seed yields of cvs. Annigeri and JG 74 at harvest were significantly correlated with the observed data (r2 = 0.89 and RMSE = 0.34 t/ha for TDM; r2 = 0.82 and RMSE = 0.14 t/ha for seed). These results show that chikpgro can be used to predict potential and water-limited yields of chickpea in the Indian plateau. Future work requires inclusion of a soil fertility submodel and model testing over a wide range of environments.}

Process-based agroecosystem simulation models generally encompass detailed descriptions of the soil, including a wide number of parameters that can be daunting to users with a limited soil science background. In this work we review and present an abridged description of the models used to simulate soil processes in the APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator) framework. Such a resource is needed because this information is currently spread over multiple publications and some elements have become outdated. We list and briefly describe the parameters, and establish a protocol with guidelines, for building a soil description for APSIM. This protocol will promote consistency, enhancing the quality of the science done employing APSIM, and provide an easier pathway for new users. This compilation should also be of relevance to users of other models that require detailed soil information.•This paper presents a brief description of the models for simulating soil processes in the APSIM model.•The method stablishes guidelines to define the parameters for building a soil description for APSIM.},

	title = {The interactive effects of nitrogen fertiliser and animal urine on nitrogen efficiency and losses in {New} {Zealand} dairy farming systems},

	url = {https://hdl.handle.net/10182/5893},
	abstract = {The loss of nitrogen (N) through nitrate (NO₃⁻) leaching and nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions from pastoral dairy systems is one of the largest challenges facing the New Zealand agricultural industry.  Nitrate leaching contributes to nutrient enrichment and accelerated eutrophication of streams, lakes and estuaries, while N₂O is both a greenhouse gas and the dominant anthropogenic emission contributing to stratospheric ozone depletion.  Urine patches are the primary source of N loss from pastoral systems due to the high N loading that occurs over a relatively small area.  Excessive or inappropriately timed fertiliser applications can also add to N loss.
Few studies have sought to determine the effect of concurrently deposited urine and fertiliser on the fate of N in pastoral systems, even though the application of fertiliser soon after grazing is commonly practised, while no studies have examined seasonal effects of any interaction.  It is generally assumed that fertiliser applied over a urine patch will simply exacerbate the total N losses, as the urine-N saturates plant-N utilisation rates in pasture.  This study, therefore, aimed to quantify the additional losses (if any) that occur as a result of fertiliser being applied concurrently onto a urine patch, and furthermore, determine the fate of the fertiliser N within the urine patch.  
To determine this, a two year lysimeter study was undertaken where urine patches were applied in either autumn or spring.  Urea fertiliser enriched with ¹⁵N was applied to these lysimeters at rates of either 200 or 400 kg N ha⁻¹ according to the standard regional practice.  The amount of fertiliser derived N was measured in the leachate, N₂O emissions, pasture and soil.  Fertiliser 15N recovered in leachate and N2O emissions was {\textless}2.2\% and {\textless}0.1\%, respectively.  Urine and fertiliser at the 400 kg N ha⁻¹ rate did increase total NO₃- leaching by up to 55 kg ha⁻¹ (p {\textless} 0.001), but this was as unlabelled N.  Pasture uptake accounted for up to 52\% of the fertiliser 15N recovery and increased plant uptake was observed under increasing fertiliser rates (p {\textless} 0.001).  Recovery of fertiliser ¹⁵N in the soil at the end of the experiment was 22\% with the majority of this in the top 10 cm soil.  Total fertiliser ¹⁵N recovery ranged from 68-81\% and it is suggested most of the unaccounted for ¹⁵N was lost as N₂ emissions and/or leached as dissolved organic N.
To further this work, data from the lysimeter experiment was validated against simulated results from a dynamic, process based model, APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator).  The APSIM simulation was designed to mimic the experimental conditions and management of the lysimeter trial for the purpose of later using it to extrapolate the lysimeter data beyond its current confines to a larger range of treatment scenarios, climatic regions and soil types.  Most of the modelled outputs were within the 95\% confidence interval of the experimental data.  However, the model significantly overestimated N₂O emissions from under urine patches, and as a result, the existing simulation was not deemed suitable to immediately carry out extrapolative predictions from the lysimeter study.  The key parameters potentially responsible for the overestimation of the modelled N₂O emissions were identified, and a sensitivity analysis was performed on these parameters.
The lysimeter trial raised further questions as to how urine patches affect pasture N uptake and soil N dynamics in the field.  Thus a field trial was established with the primary objective of determining the ‘effective area’ of a ¹⁵N labelled urine patch.  Circular plots consisting of a urine patch ‘wetted area’ (0.28 m²) and the potential ‘effective area’ were established and the pasture and soil N pools were monitored inside three distinct zones.  A total of 22\% of the urinary 15N was recovered in pasture outside the wetted area, mainly due to surrounding plant root proliferation.  Recovery of urinary ¹⁵N in the soil was much smaller than in the pasture and was short-lived.  Urinary N was recovered in the pasture up to 0.5 m from the edge of the wetted area, resulting in a total potential effective area of up to 2 m² (up to 6 times the wetted area).
In summary, this work has shown that when N fertiliser is applied over a urine patch at a rate of 400 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ there is an increase in the amount of N leached, compared to urine alone, but that fertiliser N applied over a urine patch at 200 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ does not increase the N loss.  This study also suggests that improved validation and parameterisation of N₂O emissions is required before the APSIM model can be used to produce accurate representations of the fate of N under urine and fertiliser deposition.  Finally, using ¹⁵N recovery, the results suggest that the area affected by a urine patch is larger than the wetted area, primarily due to root extension and proliferation of the surrounding pasture.},

However, few studies have sought to determine the effect of concurrently deposited urine and fertiliser on the fate of N in pastoral systems, even though the application of fertiliser soon after grazing is commonly practised, while no studies have examined seasonal effects of any interaction. The objective of this study was therefore, to understand how the combination of fertiliser-N and urine affected fertiliser-associated NO3− leaching losses and plant uptake of N. A two year lysimeter study was undertaken with urine (800kg Nha−1) applied in either autumn or spring. Urea fertiliser enriched with 15N was applied to these lysimeters at rates equivalent to 200 or 400kg Nha−1 per year according to the standard regional practice. Urine and fertiliser at the 400kg Nha−1 rate increased total NO3− leaching by up to 58kgha−1 (P{\textless}0.001), from urine applied in either autumn or spring. Fertiliser applied at 200kg Nha−1 did not increase N leaching from urine patches. Fertiliser 15N recovery in drainage was {\textless}2.2\% and was not affected by fertiliser rate. Pasture uptake accounted for up to 52\% of the fertiliser 15N recovery and this increased with increasing fertiliser rates, even in the presence of urine. Recovery of fertiliser 15N in the soil at the end of the experiment averaged 22\% with the majority of this in the top 10cm soil. These results indicate that the potential for leaching of fertiliser N, applied to a urine patch, is low, and that avoiding fertiliser application over urine patches, reduces leaching losses of fertiliser-N by {\textless}2\%, which is minimal in terms of total N loss mitigation. However, at high fertiliser application rates to urine patches (i.e. 400kg Nha−1), the total N leaching from non-fertiliser (non 15N-enriched) sources can increase. Further work is required to quantify these effects at the paddock scale. The results also show that NO3− leaching losses were greater from autumn applied urine compared to spring applied urine by up to 306kg NO3−-Nha−1.},

	abstract = {There is a strong link between nitrate (NO3-N) leaching from fertilized annual crops and the rate of nitrogen (N) fertilizer input. However, this leaching-fertilizer relationship is poorly understood and the degree to which soil type, weather, and cropping system influence it is largely unknown. We calibrated the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator process-based cropping system model using 56 site-years of data sourced from eight field studies across six states in the U.S. Midwest that monitored NO3-N leaching from artificial subsurface drainage in two cropping systems: continuous maize and two-year rotation of maize followed by unfertilized soybean (maize-soybean rotation). We then ran a factorial simulation experiment and fit statistical models to the leaching-fertilizer response. A bi-linear model provided the best fit to the relationship between N fertilizer rate (kg ha−1) and NO3-N leaching load (kg ha−1) (from one year of continuous maize or summed over the two-year maize-soybean rotation). We found that the cropping system dictated the slopes and breakpoint (the point at which the leaching rate changes) of the model, but the site and year determined the intercept i.e. the magnitude of the leaching. In both cropping systems, the rate of NO3-N leaching increased at an N fertilizer rate higher than the N rate needed to optimize the leaching load per kg grain produced. Above the model breakpoint, the rate of NO3-N leaching per kg N fertilizer input was 300\% greater than the rate below the breakpoint in the two-year maize-soybean rotation and 650\% greater in continuous maize. Moreover, the model breakpoint occurred at only 16\% above the average agronomic optimum N rate (AONR) in continuous maize, but 66\% above the AONR in the maize-soybean rotation. Rotating maize with soybean, therefore, allows for a greater environmental buffer than continuous maize with regard to the impact of overfertilization on NO3-N leaching.},

	abstract = {Subsurface drainage is a beneficial water management practice in poorly drained soils but may also contribute substantial nitrate N loads to surface waters. This paper summarizes results from a 15-yr drainage study in Indiana that includes three drain spacings (5, 10, and 20 m) managed for 10 yr with chisel tillage in monoculture corn (Zea mays L.) and currently managed under a no-till corn–soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation. In general, drainflow and nitrate N losses per unit area were greater for narrower drain spacings. Drainflow removed between 8 and 26\% of annual rainfall, depending on year and drain spacing. Nitrate N concentrations in drainflow did not vary with spacing, but concentrations have significantly decreased from the beginning to the end of the experiment. Flow-weighted mean concentrations decreased from 28 mg L−1 in the 1986–1988 period to 8 mg L−1 in the 1997–1999 period. The reduction in concentration was due to both a reduction in fertilizer N rates over the study period and to the addition of a winter cover crop as a “trap crop” after corn in the corn–soybean rotation. Annual nitrate N loads decreased from 38 kg ha−1 in the 1986–1988 period to 15 kg ha−1 in the 1997–1999 period. Most of the nitrate N losses occurred during the fallow season, when most of the drainage occurred. Results of this study underscore the necessity of long-term research on different soil types and in different climatic zones, to develop appropriate management strategies for both economic crop production and protection of environmental quality.},
