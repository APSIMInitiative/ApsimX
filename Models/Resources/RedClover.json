It can now be be found in swards around the world in places with temperate and subtropical climates.  Although considered a perennial, red clover plants are typically short-lived in grazed conditions (2-4years).  The plant has deep taproots and long segmented semi-erect stems. From each stem segment tri-foliate leaves grow alternately and from their axils a flower stalk (peduncle) may grow, petioles are 1-4 cm long.  Roots are quite thick and can reach depths greater than 2.0 m.  The inflorescence is typically pink/red and grows from peduncles that are less than 1cm long.  As a legume, red clover can host N-fixing bacteria (*Rhizobium*) in a symbiotic relationship; from this, large quantities of N from the atmosphere can be incorporated to the soil ([HeichelEtAl1985]; [ChmelikovaEtAl2015]).  This is a major reason why red clover is sown alongside grasses in pastures, although red clover is also a valuable forage grown in monoculture, producing very high quality feed and is highly palatable to ruminants.  \n\n\n**Objective:**  The model presented here was built using the Plant Modelling Framework (PMF) of [brown_plant_2014] to simulate the growth of red clover as forage crop.  The model current focus is on describing biomass accumulation and regrowth after harvest on monocultural swards. As a derivate of APSIM's PMF, it is readily possible to use the red clover model for mixed swards, but this has not been properly tested yet and should be done with caution.  The number of datasets available for the inital development of the model was quite limited, including data from only two environments and from experiments varying irrigation or fertiliser rates.  It is expected that more datasets will be added in the future to broaden the tests and support model improvements.  \nThe simulation of variations in N concentration over the growing season can also be considered as incipient and only reasonably good. The model should be updated and its performance revised in the future when more data becomes available.  \n\n**Note:** The model structure and paramaters were developed based on findings and data collated from a literature review and supported by analyses of the datasets presented in the validation section. Thus, the data from these datasets were not explicitly separated for calibration and validation.  This was done firstly because calibration of any parameter against these data was minimal, and secondly because there was a limited amount of data and thus dividing them would be counter-productive.  This would limit even more the amount of data and increase uncertainties, the method used to separate the data could become more important to define the success of the model calibration or validation than the model itself(e.g. [SinclairAndSeligman2000_CropModeling]; [MouradEtAl2005_CalibValid]).\n\r\n## Presentation\r\n\r\nThis model has been built using the Plant Modelling Framework (PMF) of [brown_plant_2014] to simulate the growth of red clover ( *Trifolium pratense* ) as a forage crop.  The model focus primarily on describing the vegetative growth, with a simplified account of the reproductive phase, without explicit considering flowers and seeds. The red clover model simulates the above ground plant structure, including the photosynthesis process, using the SimpleLeaf procedure of PMF, which does not consider explicitly leaf age or placement in the canopy.  The model describes a perennial crop, with phenology rewinding to the vegetative stage at the end of the reproductive phase.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Inclusion in APSIM simulations\r\nTo include red clover in a simulation the procedure is the same as any other APSIM crop:\r\n\r\n - The red clover object can be dragged or copied from the Crop folder in the toolbox into a Field in your simulation;\r\n - To become active and grow, the red clover crop needs to be sown using a manager script with a sowing rule. e.g.:\r\n<pre><code class='language-cs'>\r\n RedClover.Sow(cultivar: Colenso, population: 450, depth: 5, rowSpacing: 100);  \r\n</code></pre>\r\nIf a specified cultivar is not available, a fatal error will be thrown.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Harvest and biomass removal\r\nRed clover biomass can be removed by raising one of the valid methods: Harvest, Cut, Graze, or Prune; this is done using a manager script, similarly to other crops.  The proportion of the biomass of each organ that is removed from the system and/or added to the residue pools may be specified; otherwise defaults will be used.  Note that the sum of fractions removed and added to residue should be <= 1.0.  To specify the proportions for removal in a manager script, use a RemovalFractions class as shown below:\r\n<pre><code class='language-cs'>\r\n[EventSubscribe(\"Commencing\")]  \r\nprivate void OnSimulationCommencing(object sender, EventArgs e)  \r\n{  \r\n  RemoveFraction = new RemovalFractions(RedClover.Organs);  \r\n}  \r\n[EventSubscribe(\"DoManagement\")]    \r\nprivate void OnDoManagement(object sender, EventArgs e)  \r\n{  \r\n  if (Clock.Today.Date == HarvestDate)  \r\n  {  \r\n    RemoveFraction.SetFractionToRemove(\"Leaf\", 0.80);  \r\n    RemoveFraction.SetFractionToRemove(\"Stem\", 0.50);  \r\n    RemoveFraction.SetFractionToResidue(\"leaf\",0.05);\r\n    RedClover.Harvest(RemoveFraction);  \r\n  }\r\n}  \r\n </code></pre>\r\nThe RemovalFractions class can be sent with Harvest, Cut, Graze, or Prune events. All parameters are optional, defaults are used whenever any value is not specified.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Crop termination\r\nTo fully terminate a crop the EndCrop event should be raised:\r\n<pre><code class='language-cs'>\r\n RedClover.EndCrop();  \r\n</code></pre>\r\nOnce a crop has been ended the field is open to be used by another APSIM plant model, or another red clover crop.  Note that ending red clover is not necessary before sowing another crop, competition for resources will take place between crops when there is more than one in the field.\r\n",

As red clover requires long days for flowering, the trigger to end this phase is defined by the length of day, or more spcifically by the increase in daily photoperiod.  The plants need a few days under favourable conditions, photoperiod increasing and greater than a threshold, to start the reproductive phase.  \nCultivars of red clover are often grouped by flowering date, as in early, intermediate, or late flowering; thus different cultivars require different photoperiods to trigger flower initiation ([Aitken1964flowering]; [Fagerberg1988Phenol]; [ClaydonEtAl1993colenso]).  The variability in response of induction to environmental condition is considerably in red clover and not well understood (e.g. [JonesAndThomas1993gibberelins]; [FanEtAl2004cutting]).  In most stands at least some plants will show reproductive growth, but often not all the plants in the stand.  This, and genetic variability, results in considerable variation in flower initiation is any given sward.  As the model attempts to simulated an average plant, such variations are not accounted for.\r\n",

The current model does not describe the development of flower and seeds explicitly, only a generic organ referred to as *inflorescence* is defined.  The reason for this is because there isn't enough data to devise and parameterise these processes while there is considerable variability in the phenology of reproduction of red clover.  Often there are seeds maturing while new flowers are still being initiated over summer (e.g. [Aitken1964flowering]; [CliffordAndAnderson1980seed]).  Also due to their similarities and the fact that a population is describe in the model (instead of single plants), peduncles and petioles are simulated as a single organ.  \r\nFlower emergence starts in spring when day light is increasing, heading peaks in summer, and ceases in early autumn ([Aitken1964flowering]; [CliffordAndAnderson1980seed]; [ClaydonEtAl1993colenso]).  The actual periods vary for different cultivars, with early flowering ones having typically longer reproductive phases.  The model uses the accumulation of degrees-day to simulate the progression and to trigger the end of this phase.  \nManagement practices, such as applying N fertiliser, irrigation, and defoliations, may have an impact on flower and seed production ([Brougham1959graze]; [CliffordAndAnderson1980seed]; [FanEtAl2004cutting]), but there is large variation in the responses, depending on the cultivars as well as the extent and timing of the intervention.  Currently, the model does not account for the effect of this practices explicitly, although it is expected that some effects are captured by changes in biomass allocation caused by actions such as irrigation or defoliation.  \r\n",

The value for SLA is currently assumed to be constant, although factors such as age and environmental conditions (shading and nutrient status) should have an effect on this value.  Variations due to age can ignored because the model simulates a generic population, and thus it represents leaves of varing ages at the same time.  According to available studies, the effects of shading and nutrition, as well as water deficiency, are typically only manifested when these conditions are mantained for some time (e.g. [HerautBronEtAl2000]; [JoggiEtAl1983_RedClover]) and may not be important for average swards.  The model may have to be revised in the future to account for some of these factors, preferably with some experimental data.  Available data suggest that SLA of red clover varies approximately between 0.020 and 0.035 m2/g, with some variation due to cultivar; mean values for adult plants are around 0.030 m2/g ([denHollanderEtAl2007]; [MurrayThesis2012]; [MasonEtAl2016_LeafEcon]).  \r\n",

The value is computed as the sum of a base demand, simply based on the potential partition according to the target proportions, and a deficit demand, which diverts more biomass to organs that deviate from their targeted proportions. This ensures faster regrowth of above ground organs after defoliation. The target proportion may vary with growth stage and environmental conditions.  \r\n",

The value is computed as the sum of a base demand, simply based on the potential partition according to the target proportions, and a deficit demand, which diverts more biomass to organs that deviate from their targeted proportions. This ensures faster regrowth of above ground organs after defoliation. The target proportion may vary with growth stage and environmental conditions.  \r\n",

These organs are composed by a mixture of infected and non infected plant cells that behave as an isolated organ, but under general control of the host plant.  This is a symbiotic relationship whereby the plant supplies carbon and energy to the the bacteria which in turn provide the plant with N fixed from the atmosphere.  Nodules of red clover are of indeterminate type, these are more complex than determinate types (including a meristematic zone) and have a much longer life span ([PuppoEtAl2005]; [RusselleEtAl2008]).  However, the model currently does not simulate variations in nodule development nor on N fixation capacity due to varying bacteria strains.  \r\nThe host plant controls the supply of sugars and oxygen to the nodules, thus regulating the N fixation rate and, by extention, the growth and senescence of nodules ([PuppoEtAl2005]; [RusselleEtAl2008]; [HaagEtAl2013]). The model simulates this by linking the respective processes to the plants N status.  \r\n",

Thus nodule growth demand is inversely proportional to the plant's N deficiency factor.  \r\n*Rhizobium* bacteria are ubiquitous in soils (e.g. [CrushChapter1987]; [VlassakEtAl1997]; [RusselleEtAl2008]), although strains vary widelly in infection capacities and fixation efficiencies.  Thus, in typical growing conditions nearly all red clover plants will have some nodulation, add to this the fact that the model simulates a population instead of a single plant, the model assumes that nodule biomass never goes below a minimum threshold, as propotion of below ground biomass.  This also ensures a prompt minimum capacity for N fixation.  \r\n",

The value is computed as the sum of a base demand, simply based on the potential partition according to the target proportions, and a deficit demand, which diverts more biomass to organs that deviate from their targeted proportions. This ensures faster regrowth of above ground organs after defoliation. The target proportion may vary with growth stage and environmental conditions.  \r\n",

                  "Text": "The rate of N fixation in legumes is highly regulated by the host plant, but in its basis it is defined by the presence and quantity of symbiont bacteria.  The RedClover model uses an approach whereby the basic fixation rate is directly proportional to the biomass of nodules ([RysAndPhung1985]; [LedgardEtAl1990]; [WarembourgEtAl1997]; [HoghJensenEtAl2002]; [RusselleEtAl2008]). This is then regulated by environmental factors and the plant ([CrushChapter1987]; [RusselleEtAl2008]).  The plants control N fixation by limiting the supply of sugars and oxygen to the nodules ([PuppoEtAl2005]; [RusselleEtAl2008]; [HaagEtAl2013]).  In the model, this is simulated as a function of N deficiency, with fixation rate being inversely proportional to the plant's N deficiency factor.  The mechanism regulating N fixation is quite fast, with fixation nearly ceasing soon after fertilisation or defoliation (e.g. [CarrollGresshoff1983]; [RusselleEtAl2008]).  By linking potential fixation to nodule biomass, the model is capable of describing both a upper limit for fixation and the temporal lag between the inception of N stress and an elevated N fixation rate.  \r\n",

This ensures faster regrowth of above ground organs after defoliation. The target proportion may vary with growth stage and environmental conditions.  \r\n",

For typical enviromental conditions (low stress levels) the data suggest a strong seasonality in biomass allocation.  Similar to other forages that are strongly taprooted, basically all growth in spring is allocated to above ground organs, whereas in summer-autumn the allocation is more even, replenishing the below ground reserves (e.g. [Evans1973RootShoot]; [HeichelEtAl1985]; [Teixeira2008DMPartition]).  The partition can be further affected by environmental conditions, with water or nutrient deficiency inducing greater root growth, while low light conditions lead to a higher allocation above ground ([GistAndMott1957]; [KendallEtAl1994GLFs]). The current model does not explicitly consider these variations, this should be upgraded when data becomes available.  \r\n\r\n",

The 'target' value is the 'ideal' relative proportion of biomass above and below ground for the plant at a given growth phase.  The approach used here mimics the allocation pattern in strongly taprooted forages (e.g. [Teixeira2008DMPartition]).  In spring, nearly all biomass is allocated to above ground organs, with the proportion reducing as the length of day increases.  In summer-autumn the allocation evenly distributed amoung all organs, favouring the replenishment of below ground reserves ([Evans1973RootShoot]; [HeichelEtAl1985]).  \nThe approach used in the RedClover model is based on that used for describing biomass partitioning in lucerne ([Teixeira2008DMPartition]), which was parameterised for Lincoln, NZ, only.  This was generalised by assuming that miminum and maximum allocations are a function of the annual variation in day length (which is a function of latitude).  Thus, the variation in allocation to above ground organs is small in the tropics and reaches a maximum near the polar circle.  This function allows for smooth transition between seasons and describe the general pattern sensibly, but it should be revised when more data becomes available.  \n",
