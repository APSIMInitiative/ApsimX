This will then give us the opportunity to change the configuration to investigate how differing\ntreatments affect the experiments.\n\n\n\r\n\t\t",

All we have to do is select [Weather], click 'Browse' and locate the weather file in the same directory as this simulation ( Examples/Tutorials/CropProductionAndDevelopment)\n5) At the bottom of the Explorer view (left sidebar), locate the [AdditionalModels] folder. In the Soils/Freeling folder copy the soil model to the Freeling model. You can also drag and drop the model if you prefer.",
