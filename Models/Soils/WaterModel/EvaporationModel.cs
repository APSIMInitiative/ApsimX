    /// The parameter U (as from CERES) represents the amount of cumulative evaporation before soil supply decreases
    /// below atmospheric demand. The rate of soil evaporation during the second stage is specified as a function of
    /// time since the end of first stage evaporation. The parameter CONA (from PERFECT) specifies the change in
    /// cumulative second stage evaporation against the square root of time.
