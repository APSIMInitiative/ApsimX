              "Text": "The Hudson experiment was conducted in the Liverpool Plains region of New South Wales, Australia (31o 45' S, 150o 45' E) to explore the water balance and productivity of nine different cropping systems including six treatments of continuous cropping of wheat ( Triticum aestivum ), sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor ), mungbeans ( Phaseolus aureus ), and chickpeas ( Cicer arietinum ) with differing cropping frequencies (Paydar et al., 2005a). The remaining three treatments involved continuous perennial pastures of lucerne ( Medicago sativa ), grass ( Panicum coloratum ), and a lucerne-grass mixture. Only the continuous wheat cropping has been chosen. The soil profile is classified as an endocalcareous, self-mulching, black vertosol (Isbell, 1996) or Ug5.15 (Northcote, 1979). The soil to around 1 m depth consists of colluvial material with 75% to 80% clay. This overlies >5 m of brown clay with variable amounts of calcium carbonate concretions. Groundwater occurs 15 m below the surface above basalt rock. Further detail on soil properties is provided by Ringrose-Voase et al. (2003). Soil water content to 3.1 m depth was measured with a calibrated neutron moisture meter (CPN 503 DR Hydroprobe moisture gauge, Boart Longyear Co., South Jordan, Utah) at regular intervals from December 1994 until January 2000. Crop and pasture growth and development and soil and crop nitrogen contents were also monitored for the duration of the trial. \n\nModel predictions are compared to measurements of soil water and naturally occurring soil chloride. Comparison of soil water data demonstrates the model's ability to simulate the water balance of two contrasting farming systems, while the soil chloride data provide an inert environmental tracer for testing model predictions of solute transport.

              "Text": "These simulations mimic the experimental work of Laura Buckthought done as part of her PhD (Buckthought 2014) and reported in Buckthought et al. (2015). Differring timings of urine depositions (none, 800 kg N /ha in autumn, 800 kg N /ha in spring) and amounts of fertiliser (0, 200 and 400 kg N /ha /year applied in eight applications) were used in a complete factorial experimnet with four replicates. A ryegrass - white clover pasture was grown in seepage lysimeters that contained intact cores of a Horotiu Silt Loam. \n\nThe simulation mimics the experimental set up with standard values and components used. The exception to this was the inclusion of a Manager componed used to address known issues in the simulation of denitrification, mineralisation and nitrification in these high-organic matter allophanic soils in New Zealand's temperate regions. The quality of the C and N simulation is not the target of this test but the excessive denitrification was depressing plant growth so denitrification parameters were adjusted downwards.\n\nThe primary results used here include the amount of pasture harvested and the amount of drainage measured from the lysimeters. Data on the leachoing of nitrate is included for reference. Drainage is slightly over-estimated ccompared to the measurements and it is highly likely that this is a result of the underestimation of pasture growth, which again is likely caused by the C and N simulation (leaching of N is too high). \n\nThe fourth graph shows the reults of the water mass balance checks. Over the 18 months of the experiment a there was a gain of less than 0.002 mm of water which is considered to be acceptable.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuckthought, L. E. (2014).

Exp data collected from 2-replications. Large plot size. \n\n### Status of the sim (May 2022) - SVA notes:\n1. Weather comes a local station (on site) and public data, synthetic file. \n2. Soil profile is identical to the one used in classic\n3. Management is 95% final (need to double check and verfiy as we noticed some errors in the conversion from classic to NG)\n4. Cultivars: we used a fixed corn and a fixed soy cultivar for all years, we have not yet converted all the cultivars from classic to NG \n5. Additional measured data to be added (work in progress)\n\n### Relevant publications\n1. Pasley et al., 2021 (Env Res Letters) https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/abef8f \n2.

Exp data collected from 3-replications. Each plot (size 24 rows x about 30 m long) has three subsurface tiles drainage, two at the border and one at the center of each plot. Subsurface drainage and N leaching were collected approx. every 5-days (March to November). Soil moisture and WT data were collected using Decagon sesnors. WT well depth about 2.5m.     \n\n### Status of the sim (May 2022) - SVA notes:\n1. Weather comes a local station (on site) until 2018, after than we use data from IEM station (5 km distance from the site)\n2. Soil profile is identical to the one used in classic\n3. Management is 95% final (need to double check and verfiy as we noticed some errors in the conversion from classic to NG)\n4. Cultivars: we used a fixed corn and a fixed soy cultivar for all years, we have not yet converted all the cultivars from classic to NG \n5. Additional measured data to be added (work in progress)\n\n### Relevant publications\n1.

              "Text": "https://www.apsim.info/documentation/model-documentation/soil-modules-documentation/swimv2-1/\n\n# Overview\n\nSWIM3 (Huth et al., 2012) allows three of the four lower boundary conditions described in Verburg et al. (1996) as described below. The zero flux lower boundary condition has not been enabled. \n\nAll references to \"SWIM\" here refer to the highly detailed documentation by Verburg et al. (1996) of the standalone model that has morphed over the years into SWIM3. Verburg et al. remains the definitive documentation and should be referred to for detail.\n\nSee the \"SWIM3_SetLowerBC\" Manager script (to be found in both the SWIM3 example and in the Manager toolbox) for examples of how to change lower boundary conditions.\n\n## SetLowerBCForGradient(bbcGradient)\n\nA constant gradient in soil water potential with depth is the default lower boundary condition and is applicable to most 'open field' simulations where there is free drainage from the soil. This option is ibbc = 0 in SWIM3. This lower boundary condition setting must be accompanied by the value of that gradient. This is done using a command in a Manager script along the lines of:\n\n\tSetLowerBCForGradient(bbcGradient);\n\nwhere bbcGradient is a double (real) variable with the value of the required gradient in soil water potential with depth in the soil. The set value remains in place until the user resets it.\nGravity is added to bbcGradient so the most common setting is bbcGradient = 0.0 which means that there is no gradient of soil water potential. In this case, water moves under the influence of gravity alone at the lower boundary. This is the default for SWIM3 and will prevail unless the user intervenes.\nOther gradients can be set. For example, setting bbcGradient = -1.0 will set the soil water potential gradient to counteract the effect of gravity and will essentially set a no-flow lower boundary (which is likely to result in an unstable simulation). \n\n## SetLowerBCForGivenPotential(bbcPotential)\n\nThis lower boundary condition sets a constant soil water potential at the lowest node in the simulation. Note that soil water potential is in units of cm (although units of mm are used on the user interface) and is negative in unsaturated soils. This option can be useful for mimicking the effect of a water table at the base of the simulation by setting a positive value equal to the height difference between the water table and the bottom of the simulated soil profile. Note that in this setting, water will be added to the simulation at the lower boundary as needed to maintain the user set soil water potential.\nSee the Manager script \"SWIM3_SetLowerBC\" for an example: \n\n\tSetLowerBCForGivenPotential(bbcPotential);\n\nwhere bbcPotential is the required potential as a double variable in cm. this setting is equivalent to ibbc = 1 in SWIM.\n\n## SetLowerBCForSeepage(bbcPotentialSeepage)\n\nA seepage lower boundary is a condition where no drainage can occur until a user-set head of water (i.e., a depth of saturated soil) of bbcPotentialSeepage accumulates at the base of the soil profile. Once that head is reached drainage occurs at the rate allowed by the saturated soil water conductivity under gravity only until the head falls below the user-set value. This lower boundary condition is that of ibbc = 3 in SWIM. A common usage of this boundary condition is when simulating a zero-tension (i.e., free to the atmosphere) lysimeter and in this case bbcPotentialSeepage = 0.0. See an example in \"SWIM3_SetLowerBC\":\n\n\tSetLowerBCForSeepage(bbcPotentialSeepage);\n\nwhere bbcPotentialSeepage is in cm.\n\n## Testing\n\nThe simulation below runs a simple pasture simulation in an irrigated environment with lower boundary conditions of a unit gradient (“Gradient”), zero-tension seepage as in a lysimeter (“Seepage”), and a set water potential of -500 mm (so wetter than the drained upper limit, “Potential”). \n\nThe simulation contains a Manager component to check for preservation of mass in the water balance (“CalculateRollingWaterBalance”). This component calculates daily and cumulative water balances to test for errors and drift. First the component adds up the daily water inputs (rain, irrigation), outputs (drainage, **tile drainage**, soil water evaporation, runoff, plant water uptake), and change in water storage from the start to the end of the day. Here, storage is both the water in the soil and that in any surface pond. The water balance is the water added, minus water removed, minus the increase in water stored. Note that this water balance component is generic and can be added to any simulation.\n\nSeveral plots have been produced.\n\n**Daily WaterBalance** shows that the largest absolute daily error in the water balance is less than 0.0003 mm and that there are more positive errors (water ‘lost’ in the simulation) than negative errors. Following this to the **Cumulative WaterBalance** shows the effect of the lop-sided daily errors but is reassuring in that the cumulative error is less than 0.02 mm even after six years of simulation.\n\n**WaterStored** shows the amount of water stored in the soil (none of these simulations included ponding conditions). As expected, the Potential simulation has the highest water storage because the lower boundary potential of -500 mm is wetter than the drained upper limit and water is regularly being added into the simulation to maintain that water potential. The Seepage simulation holds slightly more water in the soil than the Gradient simulation because in Seepage drainage cannot occur until the lower boundary soil water potential rises to zero. That need to the water potential to rise to zero before draining means that some water must accumulate at the base of the soil while the potential is rising and so it allows more time for plants to access the water before it eventually drains. The outcome is that there will generally be somewhat less drainage when a seepage lower boundary condition is set compared to the default unit gradient boundary condition.\n\n**PsiOfLowestLayer** shows the time series of soil water potential in the lower layer. In Potential it is the prescribed -50 cm (note that SWIM3’s outputs of psi are in cm rather than mm – something that might be fixed in the future perhaps). Seepage maintains a higher value of Psi than Gradient for most of the simulation as expected.\n\n**Gradient**, **Seepage** and **Potential** detail the time series of soil water potential in the lowest layer against drainage for each boundary condition type. Close examination of **Seepage** shows that drainage is only present when the potential is zero. Note that the drainage is the sum of that during the day while the potential is that at the end of the day so it is possible that there was some drainage during the day but a slightly negative potential at the end of the day. One feature of this boundary condition is the absence of the almost-daily small (< 1mm /day) drainage amounts that are seen in **Gradient**. The negative drainage in **Potential** is the result of inflow to maintain the -500 mm soil water potential at the lower boundary. **Drainage** and **CumulativeDrainage** show the effects of the boundary conditions more clearly.\n\nIn these simulations there is no difference in **WaterUptake** across the boundary conditions (because the simulations are well irrigated). In the absence of irrigation it would be expected that their would be higher water uptake in the seepage and potential (given a value of -500 mm) boundary conditions as they hold more water in the soil (see **WaterStored**) for the bulk of the simulation duration.\n\nOnly the constant potential boundary condition resulted in any **Runoff** (the simulations are in a relatively dry environment with a highly permeable soil). The irrigation setting for the simulations was based on soil water deficit. Therefore, as might be expected, **Irrigation** (see also ** CumulativeIrrigation**) commenced later in each season for the constant potential boundary condition and less irrigation was applied. Also as expected, slightly more irrigation was applied to the constant gradient simulation than the seepage simulation.\n\n",

This option is ISBC = 0 in SWIM. This surface boundary condition relies on the value of **bare soil runoff curve number** in the SWIM3 component. Setting this surface boundary condition is done using a command in a Manager script:\n\n\tSetSurfaceBCForCurveNumber();\n\n**NOTE: If bare soil runoff curve number is set to zero then SWIM will enable ponding and excess water at the surface will go into a pond instead of runoff.** This is equivalent to ISBC = 1 in SWIM.\n\n## SetSurfaceBoundaryCondition(PowerFunction)\n\nA simple power-law function for calculating runoff can be defined. This option is ISBC = 2 in the SWIM manual. This function requires 6 arguments to be specified. The first three arguments define the minimum, maximum and initial size of the pond (mm). The last three arguments define the parameters (hrc, roff0, roff1) to the runoff equation as defined in the SWIM manual (Verburg et al. (1996).\n\n\nSetting this surface boundary condition is done using a command in a Manager script:\n\n\tswim.SetSurfaceBCForPowerFunction(minimumSurfaceStorage: 10, \n                    \t\t  maximumSurfaceStorage: 20, \n                    \t\t  initialSurfaceStorage: 15, \n                    \t\t  precipitationConstant: 50, \n                    \t\t  runoffRateFactor: 0.2, \n                    \t\t  runoffRatePower: 2);\n\n## Testing\n\nAn experiment has been set up to show the impacts of using these two methods for setting the surface boundary condition. The first three experiment factors use the curve number approach with 3 different curve numbers (0, 50 and 90). The fouth factor uses the power-rate function.\n\nThe graphs show the following characteristics:\n* When curve number is zero there is no runoff. Instead ponding occurs at serveral points during the simulation. The lack of runoff results in more water stored in the profile.\n* Using the power function (with the above arguments) results in the lowest rate of runoff. \n* As expected, using a curve number of 90 results in the highest rate of runoff.\n* Mass balance is maintained for all options.\n\n",

Use with gravimetric water contents measured on the fine-earth fraction. Gravel assumed to not hold water as reflected in low SAT, DUL, LL15, LL and AD. The data is a combination of published or supplied measurements, pedotransfer functions, and expert opinion. See Cichota et al. (2013; Soil Research 51: 92-111, http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR12338) for a description of the pedotransfer functions. The soil carbon and fresh organic matter settings have been set as those broadly appropriate for permanent productive pastoral systems, see Cichota el al.

The simulation was set up with a bare soil, no crops, no evaporation, and 10 mm /day of rainfall. Cl was added to the top 10 mm of soil on the first day (see the AddSoluteToSoil manager) and mass balance was calculated on a daily basis. Using Factors, “exco” of the Cl was changed between 0.0 and 10. When exco = 0 the Cl is not adsorbed (no attraction to the soil surfaces). When exco = 1 the concentration on the soil surfaces in g solute / Mg soil is numerically equal to the concentration in the soil water in g solute / m3 soil water. When exco is 10 the concentration on the soil surfaces will be ten times of that in the soil water (noting the difference in units of course) and the solute is only minimally mobile.\n\nThe mass balance error was less than 0.05 kg (of 100 kg) of solute across all simulations and it did not worsen with duration of simulation. The worst mass balance was in the no-adsorption simulation and coincided with peak leaching rate when changes in concentration were relatively steep. Given this, part of the mass balance error may be due to recalculating solute amounts from the node basis of SWIM’s numerical solution onto the layer basis that APSIM uses. Regardless, the error was minimal and within the tolerance for APSIM’s purposes.  \n",

Use with gravimetric water contents measured on the fine-earth fraction. Gravel assumed to not hold water as reflected in low SAT, DUL, LL15, LL and AD. The data is a combination of published or supplied measurements, pedotransfer functions, and expert opinion. See Cichota et al. (2013; Soil Research 51: 92-111, http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR12338) for a description of the pedotransfer functions. The soil carbon and fresh organic matter settings have been set as those broadly appropriate for permanent productive pastoral systems, see Cichota el al. (2012; Soil Research 50: 694-707, http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR12208). Users should take care to adapt these to local conditions before using the data in simulations.

Currently, only NO3 and NH4 can be added with irrigation.\n\nThis simulation adds 5 irrigations (through the *AddIrrigation* manager script), each with 5 kg/ha of NO3.\n\nThe graph shows the 5 increases in NO3.\n\nNotes:\n\n1. SWIM will potentially send excess surface water to runoff, regardless of whether it is rainfall or irrigation water. The irrigation apply method has a boolean argument called 'willRunoff' to indictate whether irrigation water should potentially runoff or not. SWIM ignores this property. The result is that irrigation water may potentially be lost through runoff.\n\n2. Runoff water in SWIM does not contain solutes.\n\n3. There is no soil or wind erosion in APSIM.",

Use with gravimetric water contents measured on the fine-earth fraction. Gravel assumed to not hold water as reflected in low SAT, DUL, LL15, LL and AD.

The soil carbon and fresh organic matter settings have been set as those broadly appropriate for permanent productive pastoral systems, see Cichota el al.
