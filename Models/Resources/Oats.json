This new framework provides a library of plant organ and process submodels that can be coupled, at runtime, to construct a model in much the same way that models can be coupled to construct a simulation. This means that dynamic composition of lower level process and organ classes (e.g. photosynthesis, leaf) into larger constructions (e.g. maize, wheat, sorghum) can be achieved by the model developer without additional coding.\n\nThe oats model consists of:\n\n* a phenology model to simulate development through sequential growth phases  \n* a structure model to simulate plant morphology \n* a collection of organs to simulate the various plant parts  \n* an arbitrator to allocate resources (N, biomass) to the various plant organs  \n\nThis work builds upon an earlier APSIM Oats model that was constructed in 2007 and then published at the Australian Agronomy Conference in 2008 using data from Gatton, Tarlee and Pinery ([unkovich_development_2008]). However numerous changes have been made in the APSIM NextGen version, so simulations run under APSIM 7.10 and previous versions will give different predictions when run with APSIM NextGen.\n\nThe Oats model is broadly based on APSIM Wheat models such as NWheat ([Asseng200225], [KeatingNWheat]), NWheatS ([Asseng1998163]), Cropmod-Wheat ([Wang2002GenericCropModel]), and the earlier versions developed within the Plant Modelling Framework ([brown_plant_2014]).\n",

              "Text": "Oat crops exhibit a range of developmental responses to environment and these are strongly influences by genotype characteristics.\nTemperature effects development increasing development rates and decreasing phase durations as temperatures increase.  These effects are captured by thermal time.  However, Oat crops also exhibit vernalisation and photoperiod sensitivities in their Vegetative phase and further photoperiod sensitivity in the EarlyReproductive phase.  Photoperiod responses are seen as a reduction in the length of a phase for a photoperiod sensitive genotype in response to a longer photoperiod.  Vernalisation responses are more complicated as they are driven by temperature but interact with photoperiod.  For vernalisation sensitive varieties (Winter types) exposure to cool temperatures or short photoperiods during the Vegetative phase will reduce the thermal time duration of the vegetative phase.  \n\nAs used in the APSIM wheat model, we draw on the Kirby Framework to capture these vernalisation and photoperiod responses.  This framework assumes that the timing of anthesis is a result of the timing of flag leaf and an additional thermal time passage from there to anthesis.  It also assumes the timing of flag leaf is a result of the Final Leaf Number which sets a target, and leaf appearance rate, which sets the rate of progress toward this target.  Leaf appearance rate is a function of Thermal time and a genotype specific Phyllochron which changes with Haun stage as described by [Jamieson_LeafAppearance_1995].    \n\nFinal Leaf Number (FLN) is modelled as the sum of three numbers:\n\nFLN = MinLeafNumber + VernalLeaves + PhotoLeaves\n\nWhere MinLeafNumber is the number of leaves that a wheat crop will produce when vernalisation is satisified early in the crops duration (before 2nd true leaf) and it is grown in a long photoperiod.  VernalLeaves are the number of leaves that are added due to vernalisation effects.  For insensitive varieties this will always be zero but this is potentially a larger number for sensitivie varieties and the number progresively decreases as the crop encounters more vernalisation.  PhotoLeaves are the number of leaves that are added to the minimum leaf number as a result of short day exposure.  For insensitive varieties this will be zero but is potential larger for more sensitivie varieties and decreases as day length increases.  More detailed explinations of the components of phenology are provided below.",
