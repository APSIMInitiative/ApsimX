This new framework provides a library of plant organ and process submodels that can be coupled, at runtime, to construct a model in much the same way that models can be coupled to construct a simulation. This means that dynamic composition of lower level process and organ classes (e.g. photosynthesis, leaf) into larger constructions (e.g. maize, wheat, sorghum) can be achieved by the model developer without additional coding.The model consists of:* a phenology model to simulate development between growth phases  * a structure model to simulate plant morphology  * a collection of organs to simulate the biomass (N and Weight) of various plant parts  * an arbitrator to allocate biomass to the various plant organs  # Pecularities of potatoPotato is a challenging crop to model because it is vegetatviely propigated.  For seed propigated crops, plants are always equally dormant at planting and their development begins from there.  With potato the physiological status of the seed tubers vary depending on:  * the conditions the mother plant encountered late in its life (Stress, Desication etc)   * the conditions that the tuber was stored in (Cool store, ground store, dry store etc)   * treatment of the seed prior to planting (chitting, cutting etc).   All of these factors infuence the developmental behaviour of the crop that is produced including:   * The timing of emergence   * The number of stems produced per plant and subsequent tuber number and canopy development   * The timing of tuber initiation and subsequent growth and partitioning   * The duration of haulm growth and subsequent tuber filling duration   There are an enormous number of potato cultivars and they all differ in their responses of post planting behavour due to pre planting seed conditions, there is not a good quantitative understanding of how environment and managemet of seed potato prior to planting influences post planting behaviour and it is beyond the scope of the current APSIM infrastructure to provide environmental conditions during storage of seed.  We have tried but with a list of excuses this long we have not yet succeeded in building the effects of seed physiology into the potato model in anything other than a very elementry way.  However, it is possible to set the model up to capture seed effects for specific simulations. # Including a potato crop in an APSIM simulationThere is a Potato example simulation available by clicking the Open an Example icon available on the first tab displayed when APSIM Next Gen is opened.  This provides a useful demonstration of how to simulate a potato crop and provides some useful graphs for viewing models predictions.  To incluce a potato crop in a simulation the Potato model needs to be added to the paddock, field or zone in which it is to be grown.  This can be done by right clicking on the Paddock, selecting Add from the drop down menu and then selecting Potato from the list that comes up.  A sowing action also needs to be set to start the crop off and a harvest event to remove the potato crop so the next crop can be simulated.  The PotatoPlantAndHarvest manager module that is included in the Potato example simulation has script written to instigate these events and can be copied from the example simulation into other simulations.## Setting sowing depth (emergence date)The potato model predicts emergence date as a function of sowing depth and all subsequent phenology is dependent on this timing.  Because this date is effected by seed physiology and can't yet be modeled we recommend that planting depth is not set at the actual planting depth, but varied to ensure the model predicts a realistic emergence date.  Planting depth is set in the 'PotatoPlantAndHarvest' module## Setting stem number (tuber number and early canopy growth)The 'PotatoPlantAndHarvest' script sets the Number of stems per seed piece.  This varies enormiously due to seed physiology and variety and should be set to a number that is realistic for the cultivar being simulated and the pre-planting treatment of the seed tubers.  This parameter influences tuber number and the early development of the canopy so should be set carefully.##Setting final leaf number (Crop duration)The duration of a potato crop is determined by the number of leaves that the mainstem produces and how long it takes for these to appear and seness.  This responds to photoperiod in many varieties and is influenced by the pre-planting treatment of seed tubers.  As such this parameter is given a default value for each cultivar but can also be set in the PotatoPlantAndHarvest script if more is know about the expected determinany of the potatoes under the circumstances being simulated.  Please read  [Brown_etal_2011] for a clear definition of final leaf number."},{"type": "APSIM.Shared.Documentation.Paragraph", "text": "The model is constructed from the following list of software components.

Each organ can have up to three different pools of biomass:* **Structural biomass** which is essential for growth and remains within the organ once it is allocated there.* **Metabolic biomass** which generally remains within an organ but is able to be re allocated when the organ senesces and may be retranslocated when demand is high relative to supply.* **Storage biomass** which is partitioned to organs when supply is high relative to demand and is available for retranslocation to other organs whenever supply from uptake, fixation, or re allocation is lower than demand.The process followed for biomass arbitration is shown in the figure below. Arbitration calculations are triggered by a series of events (shown below) that are raised every day.  For these calculations, at each step the Arbitrator exchange information with each organ, so the basic computations of demand and supply are done at the organ level, using their specific parameters. 1. **doPotentialPlantGrowth**.  When this event occurs, each organ class executes code to determine their potential growth, biomass supplies and demands.  In addition to demands for structural, non structural and metabolic biomass (DM and N) each organ may have the following biomass supplies: * **Fixation supply**.  From photosynthesis (DM) or symbiotic fixation (N)* **Uptake supply**.  Typically uptake of N from the soil by the roots but could also be uptake by other organs (eg foliage application of N).* **Retranslocation supply**.  Storage biomass that may be moved from organs to meet demands of other organs.* **Reallocation supply**. Biomass that can be moved from senescing organs to meet the demands of other organs.2. **doPotentialPlantPartitioning.** On this event the Arbitrator first executes the DoDMSetup() method to gather the DM supplies and demands from each organ, these values are computed at the organ level.  It then executes the DoPotentialDMAllocation() method which works out how much biomass each organ would be allocated assuming N supply is not limiting and sends these allocations to the organs.  Each organ then uses their potential DM allocation to determine their N demand (how much N is needed to produce that much DM) and the arbitrator calls DoNSetup() to gather the N supplies and demands from each organ and begin N arbitration.  Firstly DoNReallocation() is called to redistribute N that the plant has available from senescing organs.  After this step any unmet N demand is considered as plant demand for N uptake from the soil (N Uptake Demand).3. **doNutrientArbitration.** When this event occurs, the soil arbitrator gets the N uptake demands from each plant (where multiple plants are growing in competition) and their potential uptake from the soil and determines how much of their demand that the soil is able to provide.  This value is then passed back to each plant instance as their Nuptake and doNUptakeAllocation() is called to distribute this N between organs.  4. **doActualPlantPartitioning.**  On this event the arbitrator call DoNRetranslocation() and DoNFixation() to satisfy any unmet N demands from these sources.  Finally, DoActualDMAllocation is called where DM allocations to each organ are reduced if the N allocation is insufficient to achieve the organs minimum N concentration and final allocations are sent to organs. ![Schematic showing the procedure for arbitration of biomass partitioning.
