It provides a model that can be quickly parameterised to represent pasture species of differing traits where a more detailed model is currently lacking.  SPRUM has been designed to be parameterised with some basic pasture information that an expert would have close to hand.\n2. For studies that are not primarily interested in the pasture and don’t want to invest a lot of time in setting the pasture components of simulations but still need something to provide sensible boundaries to the nitrogen and water balance.  The SPRUM model can be included and work sensibly in a simulation without need to include additional manager modules to control it which helps users who are non-expert in simulating pasture management to include realistic pasture components in simulations.\n\nSPRUM represents key functions of pasture as follows.  Phenology is represented by two phases: a Regrowth phase where cover increases from the initial cover to the maximum cover (both specified by the user) from grazing until full canopy stages.  This is followed by a Full Canopy Phase when cover remains at the maximum value.  Radiation interception is estimated using a sigmoid function that is scaled between Start Regrowth and Full Canopy stages and between initial and maximum covers.  Different patterns of canopy recovery can be achieved by changing the initial cover and the thermal time duration of the regrowth phase as shown in the figure below.  Further variation in the pattern of canopy cover can be achieved by changing the length of the Full Canopy phase when cover remains at the maximum value.  Potential biomass accumulation is modelled using a radiation use efficiency which the user adjusts to achieve the expected pasture growth rates.  Users may also specify the nitrogen fixation capacity of the pasture to represent different legume activities.  \n![Schematic of cover patterns achieved by changing SprumPastureInstance input fields](SPRUM_cover.jpg)\n\nWater stress responses may be switched on or off by the user depending on the simulation needs. When water stress is switched on it will affect crop cover and biomass accumulation.\nNitrogen stress reduces biomass accumulation if there is insufficient N to meat minimum N concentration of growing organs. Nitrogen stress does not affect cover.\nSPRUM is not released with sets of coefficients to represent different pastures types. Instead a SprumPastureInstance model is included in a simulation where the user sets coefficients to represent the pasture required. This provides great flexibility for parameterising pastures but puts the responsibility for having sensible parameters on the model user. The name of a SprumPastureInstance is arbitrary and you may include as many as are needed to provide all the pastures for a simulation.    \n\nThe SPRUM model is built using the Plant Modelling Framework (PMF) of Brown et al., 2014 so it interfaces with other APSIM models in the same way as other plant models. SPRUM has 4 organ classes to represent different biomass components:\n\n1. A Simple leaf class called Leaf which represents the harvested parts of the pasture. Generally, this represents the leaf and stem components in different proportions.  SPRUM makes on consideration of the change in the composition of the \"Leaf\" component over time and how this would influence feed quality.  The proportion of total biomass partitioned to the leaf is 1 - RootProportion - ResidueProportion.  No senescence is modelled so leaf biomass is only reduced by BiomassRemovalEvents.\n2. A Generic organ class called residual which represents the plant parts that are not harvested and removed from the field. This could represent seed heads, stem and leaf that are not removed.  The amount of biomass partitioned to the residual and its rate of senescence is set by the user to ensure residual biomass accumulates and turns over at appropriate rates.\n3. A Root organ which extracts water and nitrogen from the soil for plant growth and returns biomass to the soil on harvest.  The user specifies the total biomass is partitioned to the root and senescence is modelled as a function of temperature so realistic patterns of root biomass accumulation and degradation are simulated.\n4. A Nodule organ which is only activated and fixes nitrogen for the legume crops.\n\n# Including SPRUM in a simulation\nSome working examples and a few parameterised SprumPastureInstances are provided in the SPRUM simulation in Examples. These are meant to provide a start point and users should carefully review these parameterisations and adapt them to best represent the pastures they want to simulate.\n\nTo use SPRUM in a simulation you must add the SPRUM model, at least one SprumPastureInstance and a BiomassRemovalEvents. The parameters in the SprumPastureInstance are:\n\n- Establishment Date - the date the SprumPastureInstance will be established in the simulation.  If left blank it will be established on the first day of the simulation.\n\n- Age At Start of Simulation - in Years.  If the simulation is to be started with an established pasture, this parameter should be set to a value higher that the years from establishment to reach Maximum root depth.  If seedling this should be zero.  Age dimension parameters are calculated relative age between establishment and years from establishment to reach Maximum root depth.  These are used to scale pasture cover and root depth while the pasture is establishing.  Canopy will reach its maximum dimension 4 times faster than the roots reach their maximum depth\n\n- Years from planting to reach Maximum root depth - in years - thes parameter determines how long it takes the pasture to reach its maximum root depth\n\n- Maximum growth rate of pasture (g/MJ) - This is the radiation use efficiency of the pasture and can be altered to achieve the productivity required for the pasture in the simulations.  Typical values for this parameter are 0.5 - 2.0 g/MJ.\n- Residue biomass proportion (0-0.5) is the proportion of total biomass partitioned to the residue component\n- Residue senescence rate (0-1) is the proportion of residue biomass that senesses and is passed to surface organic matter (where it may decompose) each day. \n- Root Biomass proportion (0-0.5) is the proportion of total biomass that is partitioned to the roots\n- Base, optima and maximum temperatures for photosynthesis (oC) are used to set temperature response profile for radiation use efficiency and subsequent biomass production.\n- Grow roots into neighbouring zone (yes or no) determines if this models roots grow into a neighbouring zone for multi zone simulations\n- Root depth (mm) is the maximum rooting depth of the pasture when it is established\n- Pasture height at and after grazing (mm)\" set the height range that the pasture will grow between Start Regrowth and FullCanopy.\n- Maximum and minimum green cover (0-0.97) set the cover range that the pasture will grow between Start Regrowth and FullCanopy.\n- Extinction coefficient (0.4-1) is a parameter that describes how quickly cover increases with increased LAI. A value of 1.0 represents a prostrate leaved pasture and this decreases for pastures with more erect leaves.\n- Regrowth duration  (oCd)\") is the thermal time it takes for the pasture to go from the start of regrowth to Full Canopy\n- Full Canopy duration  (oCd) is the thermal time that the pasture will spend at full canopy before \"Grazing\". Note that SPRUM \"Grazes\" its self but triggering a biomass removal event and rewinding its self to the Start Regrowth when it reaches the end of the full canopy phase.\n- Canopy expansion Temperature base, optima and maximum temperature thresholds determine how quickly the thermal time that drives canopy development is accumulated and so sets the temperature response of canopy development\n- Root Nitrogen Concentrations of leaf, residue and roots (g/g) determine how much nitrogen is required to grow these components\n- Proportion of pasture mass that is legume (0-1) -  determines how much N fixation the SprumPastureInstance is capable of.\n- Maximum Canopy Conductance - This controls crop transpiration demand.\n- Net radiation at 50% of maximum conductance - This also controls transpiration demand and how it responds to radiation levels.\n- Does the crop respond to water stress? If checked biomass and cover accumulation will decrease if water stress occurs.\n\nNo manager component is required for a SPRUM simulation.  It will simple establish itself on the date set in the SprumPastureInstance and graze and rewind its self each time phenology reaches the end of the Full Canopy Phase as shown in the figure below.   The amount of biomass that is removed each grazing is specified in a BiomassRemovalEvents object.  \nIf greater control over grazing times is required the user should set the FullCanopy Duration to a very high number so the model does not reach the rewind stage and then include a manager which calls the BiomassRemovalEvent on the exact dates that defoliation is required.  It is important to ensure the Stage to Set Phenology to On Removal field on the BiomassRemovalEvent is set to StartRegrowth if grazing and rewinding from a manager is to work properly.  \n\n![Schematic of stages and rewinds in SPRUM](SPRUM_Stages.jpg)\n",
