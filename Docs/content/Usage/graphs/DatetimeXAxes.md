title: "Changing datetime x axes intervals"
draft: false

To do this:

1. Click the title to display the axes controls.
2. Enter a number into the interval text box to change the date intervals.

The interval number equals number of days. The higher the number the less specific the datetime format.

- Numbers less than 30 the intervals will be in datetime format dd/MM/yyyy
- Numbers more than 30 but less than 1825 (roughly 5 years in days) the intervals will be in datetime format MM-yyyy.
- Numbers more 1825 show intervals in datetime format yyyy.

**Note:**
When no interval is given, vaxes specifics are automatically determined.
