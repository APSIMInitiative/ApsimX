    <MemoText><![CDATA[# The APSIM-PMF White Clover Model


_Rogerio Cichota, Plant and Food Research, New Zealand_


##Preamble

White clover (*Trifolium repens*) is a herbaceous perennial herb in the Fabaceae family (former Leguminosae) native of Europe and west Asia.  It can now be be found in swards around the world in places with temperate and subtropical climates.  The plant consists of a prostate stolon, which is segmented. From each segment tri-foliate leaves grow and from its axils either a flower stalk (peduncle) or a branching stolon grows.  Roots are quite thick and relatively shallow; the initial taproot dies after a year or so, but roots can also grow from each branching stolons. Cultivated varieties are commonly classified into small-, medium- and large-leaved cultivars, which besides leaf size also reflects variations in plant height and proportion of stolons.  The inflorescence is typically of white colour and grows about one third higher than the leaves.  As a legume, white clover can host N-fixing bacteria (*Rhizobium*) in a symbiotic relationship; from this large quantities of N from the atmosphere can be incorporated to the soil.  This is a major reason why white clover is typically sown alongside grasses in pastures.  Nonetheless, white clover is also a valuable forage, producing very high quality feed and is highly palatable to ruminants.  


**Objective:**  The model presented here was built using the Plant Modelling Framework (PMF) of [brown_plant_2014] to simulate the growth of white clover as forage crop.  The model current focus is on describing biomass accumulation and regrowth after harvest on monocultural swards. As derivate of APSIM's PMF, it is readily possible to use the white clovere model for mixed swards, but this has not been properly tested yet and should be done with caution.  
The simulation of variations in N concentration over the growing season can also be considered as incipient and only reasonably good. The model should be updated and its performance revised in the future when more data becomes available.

## Presentation

This model has been built using the Plant Modelling Framework (PMF) of [brown_plant_2014] to simulate the growth of white clover ( *Trifolium repens* ) as a forage crop.  The model focus primarily on describing the vegetative growth, with a simplified account of the reproductive phase, without explicit considering flowers and seeds. The white clover model simulates the above ground plant structure, including the photosynthesis process, using the SimpleLeaf procedure of PMF, which does not consider explicitly leaf age or placement in the canopy.  The model describes a perennial crop, with phenology rewinding to the vegetative stage at the end of the reproductive phase.


##Inclusion in APSIM simulations
To include white clover in a simulation the procedure is the same as any other APSIM crop:

 * - The white clover object can be dragged or copied from the Crop folder in the toolbox into a Field in your simulation;
 * - To become active and grow, the white clover crop needs to be sown using a manager script with a sowing rule. e.g.:
<pre><code class='language-cs'>
 WhiteClover.Sow(cultivar: Huia, population: 450, depth: 5, rowSpacing: 100);  
</code></pre>
If a specified cultivar is not available, a fatal error will be thrown.


###Harvest and biomass removal
White clover biomass can be removed by raising one of the valid methods: Harvest, Cut, Graze, or Prune; this is done using a manager script, similarly to other crops.  The proportion of the biomass of each organ that is removed from the system and/or added to the residue pools may be specified; otherwise defaults will be used.  Note that the sum of fractions removed and added to residue should be <= 1.0.  To specify the proportions for removal in a manager script, use a RemovalFractions class as shown below:
<pre><code class='language-cs'>
[EventSubscribe("Commencing")]  
private void OnSimulationCommencing(object sender, EventArgs e)  
{  
  RemoveFraction = new RemovalFractions(WhiteClover.Organs);  
}  
[EventSubscribe("DoManagement")]    
private void OnDoManagement(object sender, EventArgs e)  
{  
  if (Clock.Today.Date == HarvestDate)  
  {  
    RemoveFraction.SetFractionToRemove("Leaf", 0.80);  
    RemoveFraction.SetFractionToRemove("Stem", 0.50);  
    RemoveFraction.SetFractionToResidue("leaf",0.05);
    WhiteClover.Harvest(RemoveFraction);  
  }
}  
 </code></pre>
The RemovalFractions class can be sent with Harvest, Cut, Graze, or Prune events. All parameters are optional, defaults are used whenever any value is not specified.


###Crop termination
To fully terminate a crop the EndCrop event should be raised:
<pre><code class='language-cs'>
 WhiteClover.EndCrop();  
</code></pre>
Once a crop has been ended the field is open to be used by another APSIM plant model, or another white clover crop.  Note that ending white clover is not necessary before sowing another crop, competition for resources will take place between crops when there is more than one in the field.

            <MemoText><![CDATA[The thermal time is used to control many of the phenological changes in white clover.  It is calculated from the daily average temperature using three cardinal temperatures: minimum, maximum, and optimum.  Plant development accelerates as temperature increases from minimum to optimum and slows down after that, ceasing completely at maximum temperature.  There is little information about these thresholds for white clover. The minimum, or base, temperature is quite variable among cultivars, varying from -1.0 to 5oC ([BlackEtAl2006]; [MonksEtAl2009]; [MootEtAll2000]). Even less data is found for the other parameters, and they are quite variable too; optimum temperature is around 28oC and 38oC for maximum temperature ([BlackEtAl2006]; [MonksEtAl2009]).

            <MemoText><![CDATA[Germination in most clover species is very variable (e.g. [HamptonEtAl1987]; [MurrayThesis2012]), with about 70-90% of seeds germinating for white clover. Temperatures between 5 and 20oC do not affect germination rate, but so slow it down ([HamptonEtAl1987]).  The model does not consider variable germination rate, thus the population should be adjusted by the user to account for less than 100% germination when sowing. Also, following default PMF behaviour, white clover germination will occur one day after sowing, provided that the amount of soil extractable water is greater than zero.

            <MemoText><![CDATA[White clover has small seeds and these need to be placed near the soil surface to emergence sucessfully. Best emergence rate occur when seeds are sown at depth of 5mm ([Hyde1950]; [MurrayAndClements1993]), and few plants will emerge from seeds deeper than 40mm.  Variations in germination rate due to depth are not currently simulated by the model, however the sowing depth does affect timing of emergence, in combination with temperature.  This is controlled by the parameter ShootRate, which is the shoot elongation rate as function of thermal time (mm/oCd).  
Emergence of white clover occur a few days after germination ([Hyde1950]; [MootEtAll2000]), but this is quite variable (taking 5-20 days).  Both temperature and depth of seed are important factors.  Thermal time for the emergence of white clover (cv. Huia and Nomad) has been reported as being approximately 150oCd ([MootEtAll2000]; [MurrayThesis2012]), and there seem to be no significant variations between NZ cultivars ([HamptonEtAl1987]).

            <MemoText><![CDATA[During this phase, white clover plants partitions biomass to leaf+petiole, stolon, and root+taproot organs. Initially, this phase starts when plants emerge, but it is also triggered as phenology resets after the end of the reproductive phase.  The vegetative phase ends when the inductive phase starts.  
White clover is typically described as either short day or short-long day species ([Thomas1961]; [ChapterThomas1980]), which means induction is caused by exposure to short daylight lengths but reproductive growth may also be triggered by a period with long daylight.  Exposure to cold temperature can also lead to induction with subsequent initiation of inflorescence development when days become warmer and longer ([Thomas1981_SLD]; [BeattyThesis1959]). The variability in response of induction to environmental condition is considerably large in white clover. In most stands at least some plants will show reproductive growth regardless of environmental conditions. The variations show some trend when contrasting large- to short-leaved cultivars or for cultivar from different origins (especially latitude), but the effect of genotypes within each group was not found to be significant (e.g. [ChapterThomas1980]; [Thomas1982_Comparison]; [Norris1984_daylength]; [BeattyThesis1959]).  
Inducing daylight length seem to be 12 hours or less, while temperatures need to be below about 10oC ([Thomas1979_Natural]; [Thomas1981_SLD]; [Thomas1982_Comparison]; [Norris1984_daylength]; [Norris1985_Temperature]). The base white clover model uses the accumulation of days under either low temperature or small daylight length to trigger the end of the vegetative phase.

Physiologic and metabolic processes remain the same as for the vegetative phase; plants partition biomass to leaf+petiole, stolon, and root+taproot organs.

The phase ends when the plants start the reproduction growth, with the emergence of flower buds.  
There is a large level of variation in white clover plants and their flowering response to environmental conditions, with some plants reaching reproductive growth in almost any stand ([Thomas1979_Natural]; [BeattyThesis1959]). Nonetheless, in natural condition reproductive growth is typically triggered by long daylight lengths, with reported values around 14 hours ([ChapterThomas1980]; [Thomas1981_SLD];[Norris1984_daylength]).  The accumulation of days under long daylight length is used by the model to trigger the end of the inductive phase.

            <MemoText><![CDATA[During this phase the plant is partitioning biomass to all organs, including reproductive organs (peduncles, inflorescence, and seeds). The current model does not describe the flower and seeds development explicitly, only a generic organ referred to as *inflorescence* is defined. The main reason for this is the variability and complex phenology of reproduction of white clover; with seeds maturing while new flowers are still being initiated over summer and early autumn (e.g. [HydeEtAl1959]; [Thomas1987Chapter]; [MedeirosAndSteiner2000]). Also due to their similarities and the fact that a population is describe in the model (instead of single plants), peduncles and petioles are simulated as a single organ.  
Flower emergence typically starts in spring, peaks at the beginning of summer and continues until autumn ([ChapterThomas1980]; [MacfarlaneAndSheath1984]; [MarshalEtAl1993_Production]). The actual periods vary for different cultivars, and some have flower nearly all year (albeit with low frequency over winter).  A drop in flower numbers in mid-summer and subsequent increase in early autumn has been show in some cultivars and has been linked to water deficit or inhibition due to long days ([ChapterThomas1980]; [MacfarlaneAndSheath1984]).  Management practices, such as applying N fertiliser, irrigation and defoliations, have, in general, a positive impact on flower and seed production ([ChapterThomas1980]; [MedeirosAndSteiner2000]; [BissuelBelaygueEtAl2002_flower]), but there is large variation in the responses, depending on the cultivars as well as the extent and timing of the intervention. Currently, the model does not account for the effect of this practices explicitly, although it is expected that some effects are captured by changes in biomass allocation caused by actions such as irrigation of application of fertilisers.

            <MemoText><![CDATA[The leaf area index (LAI) for green leaves is defined based on biomass and the specific leaf area (SLA). The value for SLA for white clover is assumed to be constant in the current model, although the data indicates that age and some environmental factors (shading and nutrient status) have some effect on this value.  Variation due to age are ignored because the model simulates a population, as is intented to describe swards over long term, thus it should represent leaves of varing ages at the same time.  The nutritional effects are generally not linked to N, which currently is the only nutrient simulated in APSIM, thus can be ignored.  The effects of shading, as well as water deficiency, only occur when these conditions are mantained for some time, the model may have to be revised in the future to account for these factors, prefereably with some experimental data.  Available data suggest that SLA of white clover varies between 0.020 and 0.045 m2/g, with mean values for the cultivar Huia being around 0.030 m2/g ([Woledge1986_LeafAge]; [ChapmanAndRobson1992]; [KangAndBringk1995]; [HerautBronEtAl2000]; [CastleEtAl2002]; [NicholsEtAl2014_Drought]).

The petiole length varies with cultivar, tipically between 5 and 15 cm ([Brougham1958_LeafDev]; [BissuelBelaygueEtAl2002_flower]; [denHollanderEtAl2007]).  The inflorescence is typically one third higher than the leaves.

This ensures faster regrowth of above ground organs after defoliation. The target proportion may vary with growth stage and environmental conditions.

          <MemoText><![CDATA[__Note:__ this represents all the nodules containing the symbiotic N-fixing bacteria (*Rhizobium*) of the plant, without distinction between ages or placement in the root system.  
Nodules are considered plant organs that result from the infection of fine roots by *Rhizobium* bacteria ([CrushChapter1987]; [HirschEtAl1997]; [PuppoEtAl2005]; [RusselleEtAl2008]). This organs are composed by a mixture of infected and non infected plant cells that behave as an isolated organ, but under control of the host plant.  This is a symbiotic relationship whereby the plant supplies carbon and energy to the the bacteria which provide the plant with N fixed from the air.  Nodules of white clover are of indeterminate type, these are more complex than determinate types (including a meristematic zone) and have a much longer life span ([PuppoEtAl2005]; [RusselleEtAl2008]). Different strains of the *Rhizobium* bacteria can vary on their capacity to infect white clover (with some plant cultivars also showing selection to different strains) as well as on their effectiveness to fix N2 from the air. However, the model currently does not simulate variations in nodule development nor on N fixation rate due to varying bacteria strains.  
The host plant controls the supply of sugars and oxygen to the nodules, thus regulating the N fixation rate and by extention on the nodule growth and senescence ([PuppoEtAl2005]; [RusselleEtAl2008]; [HaagEtAl2013]). The model simulates this by linking the respective processes to the plants N status.

            <MemoText><![CDATA[The growth and senescence of nodules in white clover roots is regulated by the host plant, this is done in tandem with its need for N fixation by controlling the supply of sugars and oxygen to the nodules ([CrushChapter1987]; [VlassakEtAl1997]; [PuppoEtAl2005]; [RusselleEtAl2008]; [HaagEtAl2013]).  The aproach used in the white clover model to simulate this regulation is to define a base, or mean, proportion of nodules in the below ground biomass and modify it according to the plants N status. Thus nodule growth demand is inversely proportional to the plant's N deficiency factor.  
As *Rhizobium* bacteria are ubiquitous in soils (e.g. [CrushChapter1987]; [VlassakEtAl1997]; [RusselleEtAl2008]), although strains vary widelly in infection capacities and fixation efficiencies.  Thus, in typical growing conditions nearly all white clover plants will have some nodulation, add to this the fact that the model simulates a population instead of a single plant, the model assumes that nodule biomass never goes below a minimum threshold, as propotion of below ground biomass. This also ensures a prompt minimum capacity for N fixation.

            <MemoText><![CDATA[The rate of N fixation is highly regulated by the host plant, but in its basis it is defined by the presence and quantity of symbiont bacteria. The whiteclover model uses an approach whereby the basic fixation rate is directly proportional to the biomass of nodules ([RysAndPhung1985]; [LedgardEtAl1990]; [HoghJensenEtAl2002]; [RusselleEtAl2008]; [FloraThesis2013]). This is then regulated by environmental factors and the plant ([CrushChapter1987]; [RusselleEtAl2008]). The plants control N fixation by limiting the supply of sugars and oxygen to the nodules ([PuppoEtAl2005]; [RusselleEtAl2008]; [HaagEtAl2013]). In the model, this is simulated as a function of N deficiency, with fixation rate being inversely proportional to the plant's N deficiency factor. The mechanism regulating N fixation is quite fast, with fixation nearly ceasing soon after fertilisation or defoliation (e.g. [CarrollGresshoff1983]; [RusselleEtAl2008]). By linking potential fixation to nodule biomass, the model is capable of describing both a upper limit for fixation and the temporal lag between the inception of N stress and an elevated N fixation rate.

Taproots in white clover are generally efemerous.  They develop from seeds and are ubiquitous in young plants, but these die out about a year after germination and adult plant are generally described as having no taproots ([HartChapter1987]; [BrockEtAl2000]). However, some secondary roots can be taproot-like, especially in especific cultivars, e.g. ladino ([ThomasChapter1987]; [CaradusAndWoodfield1998]). Given that, and because the model simulates the a whole population, it is assumed that taproots are always present, but typically constitute a minor fraction of the root systems in most cultivars.

The value is computed as the sum of a base demand, simply based on the potential partition according to the target proportions, and a deficit demand, which diverts more biomass to organs that deviate from their targeted proportions. This ensures faster regrowth of above ground organs after defoliation. The target proportion may vary with growth stage and environmental conditions.

          <MemoText><![CDATA[The target shoot-to-root is used to alter the allocation of biomass when the balance between the various organs is disturbed, such as after a defoliation.  
Published data for the shoot-to-root ratio in white clover show a considerable variability, with values between 1.5 to 8.0 for a wide range of conditions ([HartChapter1987]; [GourleyEtAl1993]; [AlmeidaEtAl1999]; [NeergaardAndGorissen2004]; [denHollanderEtAl2007]; [MurrayThesis2012]; [CrushEtAl2015]). For typical enviromental conditions the data suggest a mean value around 2.5-3.5 for adult plants.  This value can be affected by environmental conditions, with water or nutrient deficiency inducing greater root growth, while low light conditions lead to a higher allocation above ground. The current model does not explicitly consider these variations, this should be upgraded when data becomes available.

          <MemoText><![CDATA[The model attempts to keep the proportion of the plant biomass above and below ground at a given value.  The 'target' value is the 'ideal' relative proportion of biomass above and below ground for the plant at a given growth phase. This is in accord with the biomass allocation plasticity approach (e.g. [Wilson_1988]; [LevangBrilz_2002]). The approach ensures that biomass allocation is shifted to the appropriate organs when the balance is disturbed, especially important for recovery after cut or grazing.  Studies have show that white clover, unlike most plants, has a relatively fixed proportion of biomass above ground, even during reproductive phase (e.g. [ChapterThomas1980]). The model uses the target shoot-to-root ratio to compute the proportion of biomass above ground (e.g. [JohnsonAndThornley1987]).

Where:
 - n: The number of PO (predicted-observed) pairs for the given variable;  
 - Slope: The slope of the straight line linear regression. A perfect fit would have a value of 1;  
 - Intercept: The intercept of the straight line linear regression. A perfect fit would have a value of 0;  
 - SEslope: Standard error in the slope;  
 - SEintercept: Standard error in the intercept.;  
 - R2: The value for the coefficient of determination. It varies between 0 and 1, where 1 is a perfect fit;  
 - RMSE: Root Mean Squared Error. 0 is a perfect fit. Values less than half the standard deviation of the observed data are acceptable;  
 - NSE: Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency. Indicates how well the PO data fits the 1:1 line. Ranges from -∞ to 1 with 1 being the optimal value while values  between 0 and 1 are generally viewed as acceptable. Values < 0 indicate unacceptable model performance;  
 - ME: Mean Error between predicted and observed values. 0 is a perfect fit;  
 - MAE: Mean Absolute Error. 0 is a perfect fit. Values less than half the standard deviation of the observed data are acceptable;  
 - RSR: Ratio between the RMSE and the standard deviation of observations. 0 is a perfect fit;

Where:
 - n: The number of PO (predicted-observed) pairs for the given variable;  
 - Slope: The slope of the straight line linear regression. A perfect fit would have a value of 1;  
 - Intercept: The intercept of the straight line linear regression. A perfect fit would have a value of 0;  
 - SEslope: Standard error in the slope;  
 - SEintercept: Standard error in the intercept.;  
 - R2: The value for the coefficient of determination. It varies between 0 and 1, where 1 is a perfect fit;  
 - RMSE: Root Mean Squared Error. 0 is a perfect fit. Values less than half the standard deviation of the observed data are acceptable;  
 - NSE: Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency. Indicates how well the PO data fits the 1:1 line. Ranges from -∞ to 1 with 1 being the optimal value while values  between 0 and 1 are generally viewed as acceptable. Values < 0 indicate unacceptable model performance;  
 - ME: Mean Error between predicted and observed values. 0 is a perfect fit;  
 - MAE: Mean Absolute Error. 0 is a perfect fit. Values less than half the standard deviation of the observed data are acceptable;  
 - RSR: Ratio between the RMSE and the standard deviation of observations. 0 is a perfect fit;

Simulation setup based on field trial performed at Lincoln University Research Dairy Farm, New Zealand, between 2014 and 2016.  The experiment was part of the FRNL (Forages for Reduced Nitrogen Leaching) program (for more details see [MartinEtAl2017]).  Here only plots with pure white clover are used.  
The experiment consisted of six fertiliser treatments (N rates of 0, 50, 100, 200, 350 and 500 kg/ha/yr) in four replicates, and measurements comprised yield and quality indicators (here N content is used).  
Data supplied by Grant Edwards, Lincoln University.

The soil at the experimental site was a Templeton fine sandy loam (an Immature Pallic soil, USDA: Udic Haplustept), the required parameters were inferred based on data from the New Zealand National Soils Database (Landcare Research).  
Weather data was obtained from nearby Broadfields weather station (NIWA).

This simulation setup was based on field trials performed at DairyNZ's Scott Farm, in Ruakura, New Zealand, between 2014 and 2016.  The experiment was part of the FRNL (Forages for Reduced Nitrogen Leaching) program and the data is basically unpublished (references will be added when this come about).  Here only plots with pure white clover are used.  
The experiment consisted of six fertiliser treatments (N rates of 0, 50, 100, 200, 350 and 500 kg/ha/yr) in three replicates, and measurements comprised yield and quality indicators (here N content is used).  
Observed data supplied by Grant Edwards, Lincoln University.

The soil at the experimental site was a Horotiu silt loam (an Orthic Allophanic soil; USDA: Typic Udivitrand), the parameters required were inferred using data from the New Zealand National Soils Database (Landcare Research).  
Weather data was obtained from nearby Ruakura weather station (NIWA).
