I don't think that a statistical test is suitable - this is an absolute. Use a Manager to fail the simulation if there are differences.\n\n- I added a daily aggregation to make sure it wasn't causing a problem - and it does - the sum is wrong\n\t- but only when using the original test item [Clocl].Today.DayOfYear - using a Weather variable is giveing a sensible result ",
