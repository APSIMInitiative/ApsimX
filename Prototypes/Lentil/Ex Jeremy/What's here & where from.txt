Also includes a 2001 trial Dooen (Horsham) that has obscene (though real) final yields

Most of these will be useful for passing the laugh test. Greenethorpe & Gatton are the most promising.

There are also 3 experiments (via DR) that recorded flowering date in 2001: Horsham, Beulah & Birchip.

Soils are taken from apsoil. Met data is mostly silo; some have weather stations (as patch input files)

The greenethorpe soil was characterised by jeremy and contains 5x water contents (no surface, 300-2000mm), 
layer structure for NMM is *slightly* different from apsim. The plant data is treatment means from 4 reps.

Phenology observation points are a mixed bag - this a table of occurence (days when event is observed):

Observed data in 3 sheets: phenology, harvest and daily outputs

The "lentil" PMF module is simply chickpea renamed. 

An R script (1 Make from template.R) creates the experiments from a template to make a single file with all (176) simulations. There's a table of values (eg sowdate, fert rates etc) for each factor level around L100.
