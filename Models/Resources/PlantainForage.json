It is now common around the world in suitable habitats with temperate and subtropical climates.  The plant consists of a rosette of basal semi-erect leaves which may have one or more flowering stalks.  The leaves are green to grey-green in colour, have a characteristic lanceolate shape with 3 to 5 parallel veins along the length and have few or no hairs.  The stems are leafless, growing some 10-15cm above the leaves and have scattered hairs toward the base of the plant.  Each stalk terminates in an ovoid inflorescence containing many small flowers each with a pointed bract.  The inflrescence is 1-4cm long and changes shape over time (from a cone to a cilinder) as the flowers mature from the based to the top, the colour also changes from the initial grey-green to light brown when mature.  The flowering period goes from late spring to early fall and varies between plants, it can last several months for a population of plants in a given locale.  Forage plantain does not need vernalisation to trigger flowering.  The flowers are wind-pollinated and are replaced by a small seed capsule containing two small seeds, with weight varying between 1.5 and 2.0 mg per seed. Seeds have an oblong shape and the colour varies from dark brown to black.  The root system consists of a relatively shallow crown of coarse fibrous roots including adventitious roots ([SandersonElwinger_2000a]) and although technically a taprooted species it does not have the typical solid deep taproot.  Plantain forage can allocate greater proportion of roots at depth, giving a competitive advantage over shallow root grasses ([StewartPlantain_1996]; [NieEtAl_2008]; [vanDenBergeEtAl_2014]).\n\nSelection of plantain cultivars for use as forage have focused mostly on narrow leaf varieties, which have an erect, bushy, growth habit and ability to tiller under grazing ([StewartPlantain_1996]), more recently some emphasis has also been put on the ability to growth over cold periods.  Forage plantain can grow large leaves, up to around 40cm instead of typical 15-25cm, and these are highly palatable to grazing animals, being specifically targeted by sheep ([SagarHarper_1964]; [StewartPlantain_1996]; [RumballKeog_1997]; [QuijadaThesis_2015]). Reproductive organs are less palatable and mature stalks are avoided by grazers ([StewartPlantain_1996]; [MoorheadPigot_2009]; [AyalaEtAl_2011]).  Plantain forage is highly nutritious, has good digestibility, and the mineral composition usually is higher than ryegras-clover swards ([StewartPlantain_1996]; [JacobsWard_2010]; [ElgersmaEtal_2014]; [LeeEtAlYields_2015]).  Potential medicinal effects of plantain have been suggested and few bio-active compounds that may alter rumen fermentation and N partitionin in the animal are being investigated ([StewartPlantain_1996]; [QuijadaThesis_2015]; [JansmaThesis_2016]).  \n\n\n\n**Objective:**  The model presented here has been built using the Plant Modelling Framework (PMF) of [brown_plant_2014] to simulate the growth of a forage plantin crop.  Currently, the focus is on describing biomass accumulation and regrowth after harvest on monocultural swards. As part of APSIM's PMF, using plantain forage in mixed swards is possible, but this has not been properly tested yet.  Likewise, describing the effect of population decrease on plant growth was not attempted; for swards free of weeds and within typical population ranges, the changes in plant size (number of tillers) and LAI should compensate for loss of population, but competition with weeds and others would alter this pattern significantly.  \nSimulating variations in plant N concentration (seasonal or due to changes in soil status)  is not a major focus of the current model.  Further development of PMF's supply/demand processes are needed for capturing the variations in N content typically seen in perennial species.  \n\n## Presentation\n\nThis model has been built using the Plant Modelling Framework (PMF) of [brown_plant_2014] to simulate the growth of a plantain forage crop ( _Plantago lanceolata_ ).  The model focus, thus, on describing primarily the vegetative growth, with a simplified account of the reproductive phase, without explicit considering flowers and seeds (these may be included in future releases).  To simulate the aboveground plant structure, including the photosynthesis process, the PlantainForage model uses the SimpleLeaf procedure of PMF.  The model describes a semi-perennial crop, with phenology rewinding to the vegetative stage at the end of the reproductive phase.\n\n\n## Inclusion in APSIM simulations\n\nA forage plantain crop can be included in a simulation the same as any other APSIM crop.\n\n - The PlantainForage object can be dragged or copied from the Crop folder in the tool box into a Field in your simulation;\n - To become active and grow, plantain needs to be sown using a manager script with a sowing rule. e.g.:\n~~~\n PlantainForage.Sow(cultivar: Tonic, population: 300, depth: 10, rowSpacing: 150);  \n~~~\nIf a specified cultivar is not available, a fatal error will be thrown.\n\n\n### Harvest and biomass removal\n\nPlantain forage biomass can be removed by raising one of the valid methods: Harvest, Cut, Graze, or Prune; this is done using a manager script, similarly to other crops.  The proportion of the biomass of each organ that is removed from the system and/or added to the residue pools may be specified; otherwise defaults will be used.  Note that the sum of fractions removed and added to residue should be <= 1.0.  To specify the proportions for removal in a manager script, use a RemovalFractions class as shown below:\n~~~\n[EventSubscribe(\"Commencing\")]  \nprivate void OnSimulationCommencing(object sender, EventArgs e)  \n{  \n  RemoveFraction = new RemovalFractions(PlantainForage.Organs);  \n}  \n[EventSubscribe(\"DoManagement\")]    \nprivate void OnDoManagement(object sender, EventArgs e)  \n{  \n  if (Clock.Today.Date == HarvestDate)  \n  {  \n    RemoveFraction.SetFractionToRemove(\"Leaf\", 0.80);  \n    RemoveFraction.SetFractionToRemove(\"Stem\", 0.50);  \n    RemoveFraction.SetFractionToResidue(\"leaf\",0.05);\n    PlantainForage.Harvest(RemoveFraction);  \n  }\n}  \n~~~\nThe RemovalFractions class can be sent with Harvest, Cut, Graze, or Prune events. All parameters are optional, defaults are used whenever any value is not specified.\n\n\n### Crop termination\nTo fully terminate a crop the EndCrop event should be raised:\n~~~\n PlantainForage.EndCrop();  \n~~~\nOnce a crop has been ended the field is open to be used by another APSIM plant model, or another plantain crop.  Note that ending plantain forage is not necessary before sowing another crop, competition for resources will take place between crops when there is more than one in the field.\n\n\n## Acknowledgements\nThis model was developed with help from Brittany Paton and Russel McAuliffe organising data and simulations.

Crop development acelerates as temperature increases from minimum to optimum and slows down after that, stopping completely when maximum temperature is reached.  There is very little information about these thresholds for plantain, the minimum temperature seem to be quite variable as one of the main traits that vary among cultivars is the growth over winter. For \"chinese plantain\" ( _Plantago  asiatica_ ) the minimum temperature varies between 3 and 14 oC ([IshikawaEtAl_2007]), which gives an idea of potential variations for this parameter in plantain. Plantain forage is tolerant to high temperatures ([StewartPlantain_1996]; [NieEtAl_2008]) and outgrows ryegrass over summer in subtropical climate ([MoorheadPigot_2009]). The data for chinese plantain suggest similar growth, and thus the optimum and maximum temperature for it, 30 and 38oC respectively ([IshikawaEtAl_2007]), should give a good indication of the values for forage plantain.\n",

Flower stages and seeds development are not explicitly described in the current model, only a generic organ refered to as _inflorescence_ is defined.  This was done partly due to lack of data and partly because of the variability and complex phenology of forage plantain.  There is a lot of variation among plantain plants regarding when flowering occurs and how long it lasts, plus even the same plant can have flowering stalks, stalks with young seeds, as well as stalks with ripen seed at the same time ([Rowarth_Plantain_1990]; [RumballKeog_1997]; [LaceyRoach_2003]; [GonzalezParrado_2015]).  Seed ripenning is reached some 8-10 weeks after flowering, with commercial cultivars closer to the low end of the range.  The available data suggest an accumulation of 450oCd for the flowering period, with base temperature between 5 and 9oC ([Rowarth_Plantain_1990]; [RumballKeog_1997]; [GonzalezParrado_2015]).  Howerver flowering continues throughout the summer into autumn and seem to be curtailed only by frosts ([Rowarth_Plantain_1990]) and/or short days ([SandersonEtAl_2003]).  In the PlantainForage model the photoperiod is used to define the end of reproductive phase, following the same approach used to start it.  And correspondelly, the accumulation of days shorter than 12 hours is used as the trigger the end of the phase (this approach also ensures phenology reset even in warmer climates).  Note that the DM partition functions also use photoperiod to change priority allocation into reproductive organs, with maximum allocation only when daylight length is greater than 14hours.  This was done to limit the allocation to reproductive organs on the sason shoulders when only few plants are actively in the reproductive phase (e.g. [SandersonEtAl_2003]).\n",

Values for CO2 assimilation rates are generally consistent ([PootDenBroek_1997]; [LabreveuxThesis_2002]; [vanDenBergeEtAl_2014]; [CranstonEtAl_2015]) and follow a classic relationhip with light intensity (directly proportional) as well with N concentration in the leaves (inversely proportional).  Reported values of photosynthetic rate indicate that these are similar or slightly higher in plantain forage when compared to Chicory ([LabreveuxThesis_2002]; [CranstonEtAl_2015]).  No reported values for RUE were found in the literature, but they can be infered as to be just under 2.0 g DM/MJ for wild vareties ([PootDenBroek_1997]).  \nThe current model assumes generic responses to enviromental factors, such as temperature and water availability.  Wild plantain is ubiquitous in meadows in subtropical climates around the world, and it is generally assumed to be tollerant to high temperatures but not to cold ([SagarHarper_1964]; [StewartPlantain_1996]).  Forage plantain shows large differences between cultivars, but generally can grow more over winter compared to wild varieties and still outperform temperate grasses in summer ([StewartPlantain_1996]; [MoorheadPigot_2009], [DouglasEtAl_2013]), although survivability in harsh winters in the USA was found to be low ([SandersonEtAl_2003], [SkinnerPlantain_2005]).  Forage plantain is also often mentioned as a drought tollerant species ([StewartPlantain_1996]; [DouglasEtAl_2013]; [QuijadaThesis_2015]), although less so than deep rooted species such as chicory or lucerne.  The use of reserves from the taproots seem to be mechanism used to confer drought resistance in plantain as is the case for many herbs ([CranstonEtAl_2015]; [QuijadaThesis_2015]).\n",

To accomplish this, the taproots' biomass is partioned into structural and non-structural fractions, the later is available to be used in new growth (via biomass retranslocation).  There is very few data on how much reserves are kept in plantain taproots, results from [QuijadaThesis_2015] suggest that sugars plus fructan made up 4-11% of taproots biomass compared to 15-35% in chicory, which is consistent with plantain forage having much smaller taproots.  Based on these values, and some trial and error, the parameters related to retranslocation (StructuralFraction, DMRetranslocationFactor, and NRetranslocationFactor) were estimated.  These should be upgraded when more data is made available.  \n",

This is a simplified approach to biomass allocation plasticity (e.g. [Wilson_1988]; [LevangBrilz_2002]), it assumes that the plant switches allocation of towards leaves whenever the current shoot:root ratio differs from the target value.  \nPublished data for the shoot:root ratio in plantain is highly variable, with values as low as 1.0 for wild varieties and as high as 6.0 for seedlings of commercial cultivars with no water of nutrient limitations ([SchippersOlff_2000]; [LabreveuxThesis_2002]; [CranstonEtAl_2015]; [PankokeEtAl_2015]).  The data suggests mean values to be around 1.75-2.0 for adult plants.  This value is likely to be affected by environmental conditions, with water or nutrient deficit favouring root growth, while low light conditions leading to higher allocation above ground. However, these relationships can vary considerably in different plants and there is little data for plantain forage, so the model current ignores the influence of environmental factors on the shoot:root partition, this should be upgraded when data becomes available.\n\n\n",

The allocation of biomass to leaves is defined primarily by the target shoo:root ratio, but during the reproductive phase, the partition is further modified based on the ratio of stems+inflorescence to leaves. This ratio may be affected by defoliation ([AyalaEtAl_2011]; [QuijadaThesis_2015]) and is probably affected by enviromental factors too. There is not enough data to describe these interactions.  \nPublished results suggest that reproductive parts represent a relatively small proportion of the biomass, about 10-25% in grazed swards, and about 40% if not grazed ([SchippersOlff_2000]; [LabreveuxThesis_2002]; [MoorheadPigot_2009]; [AyalaEtAl_2011]).\n",

Allocation during the reproductive phase will attempt to keep a ratio between stem and inflorescence biomass.  This ratio is probably affected by enviromental factors, but there is not data to determine how these would interact.  Because of the short period between stem elongation, flowering and seed maturity, and a relatively long reproductive phase, forage plantain plants will have ripe seeds as well as young stalks at the same time.  This makes quite difficult to define variation in biomass allocation to inflorescence.  Inference from published values suggest that the ratio of flower biomass to stems varies from around 0.1 to nearly 0.4 ([SchippersOlff_2000]).  \n\n",
