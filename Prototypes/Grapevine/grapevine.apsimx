Grapevines are now cultivated in more than 90 countries for wine, distilled liquors, juice, table grapes, and raisin production (Fereres and FAO OIV, 2016). Because of its global economic importance, the climate diversity of the producing regions, and a large amount of studies (from genomics to production practices), grapevine has emerged as a model perennial fruit crop species.\n\n##Objective\nThe model presented here was built to simulate the phenology,light interception, carbon allocation and storage, and yield formation of grapevine (Vitis vinifera) as a model perennial crop. \r\n\r\n##Model construction\n\r\nThe APSIM Grapevine model was developed using the Plant Modelling Framework (PMF) of [brown_plant_2014]. This new framework provides a library of plant organ and process submodels that can be coupled, at runtime, to construct a model in much the same way that models can be coupled to construct a simulation. This means that dynamic composition of lower level process and organ classes (e.g. photosynthesis, leaf) into larger constructions (e.g. maize, wheat, sorghum) can be achieved by the model developer without additional coding.\r\n\nA series of development was taken to adapt the source code to simulate the perennial woody plants. The current model including the following features:\n\n• A row strip configuration to represent the vineyard setup.\n\n• An adopted strip light interception model to capture the canopy heterogeneous and to calculate the light interception by grapevine and inter-row cover crops\n\n• A new carbon allocation method to allocate the carbohydrate simultaneously based on sink strength as well as sink priority. The new method capture the dynamics in carbon storage in perennial organ as well.\n \n• An adapted phenology model which starts from endodormancy of the bud instead of emergence and reset to endodormancy by a management method (pruning) in winter to capture the perennial behaviour\n\n• Using bud number per vine as input in the “sowing” method (model initialization) and calculating the number of primary shoots per vine based on fraction of budburst as a function of bud number\n\n• An adopted strip water competition method to calculate water competition between grapevine and inter-row cover crops\n\nThe carbon assimilation and carbon allocation needs some further fine calibrations. so the effects of carbon stress has not been added to the yield formation processes, e.g. bunch number and berry number determination. Bunch number, berry number and potential berry fresh weight were determined by weather conditions at critical periods around flowerings of the previous and current season, see details at Zhu et al., 2020 OENO one. Berry dry mass accumulation following the source-sink carbon allocation rules. For getting a reliable estimation of yield and phenology, simulations should start one season before the season in question. \n\r\n",

                  "Text": "The phenology model starts from endodormancy instead of emergence in annual crops. \n\nThe phenology module goes through phases of Endodormancy, Ecodormancy, BudBurst, Flowering, FruitSet, Veraison and LeafFall. Except the LeafFall phase, which is a leaf death phase class, all other phases are parameterised using the generic phase class. The generic phase class has two main properties: target and progression. Progression defines how units were accumulated to achieve the target of the phase on daily time step. It can be defined by any function in the UI. \nThe phenology module assumes the endodormancy starts when a critical photoperiod is reached. Endodormancy is defined as the period when buds are dormant due to physiological conditions, and ecodormancy is defined when buds remain dormant due to unfavourable environmental conditions (Sarvaš, 1974).\n\nThree budburst modelling approaches were tested based on our phenology dataset (Parker et al. 2021): 1) forcing-only approach, which only describes the ecodormancy; 2) chilling-forcing, which describes the endo- and ecodormancy in sequence; 3) chilling-forcing-overlap, which describes the endo- and ecodormancy in sequence plus the effect of chilling units on forcing accumulation through implementation of an exponential decrease function. Chilling-forcing approach was selected in the current grapevine model but users can change to different approaches in the UI. In this approach, ecodormancy is induced when the chilling requirement is satisfied, and then followed by a period with forcing temperatures calculated by growing degree day until bud burst (Chuine, 2000). A negative sigmoid function was selected for simulating the responses of chilling units to different temperatures (Eq. 1) and a growing degree day approach was used for the forcing unit (Eq. 2). \n\t\tR_c (Ta)=1/〖1+e〗^((-((Ta-a))/b)) \t\t\t\t\tEq. 1\n\t\tR_f (Ta)={█(         0,■(&      Ta<Tb) @Ta-Tb,■(&  Ta≥ Tb))┤\t\t\tEq. 2\nRc(Ta) is the rate of chilling accumulation at hourly air temperature Ta. The rate is further divided by 24 to scale to daily step. a (equal to 12.4°C) and b (-3.8) are fitted parameters. Rf(Ta) is the rate of forcing accumulation. Tb (0°C) is the fitted base temperature. In APSIM, hourly temperature is interpolated based on the method described in Goudriaan and Van Laar (1994). \n\nThe flowering, fruit set and véraison phase was simulated using a thermal day (td) target. The thermal day unit was calculated by the Wang-Engle temperature response function (Eq. 3 to 5), which returns values from zero to one (Wang and Engel, 1998). Thermal day was used for all other time-dependent events and function as well, e.g. leaf appearance and expansion. \nf_T=(2〖(T_ -T_min)〗^α 〖(T_opt-T_min)〗^α-〖(T_ -T_min)〗^2α)/〖(T_opt-T_min)〗^2α    ■(&T_min≤T≤T_max )\t    \tEq. 3 \nα=ln2⁄(ln⁡[((T_max-T_min))⁄((T_opt-T_min))])\t\t\t\t\tEq. 4\nf_Tref=(2〖(T_ref-T_min)〗^α 〖(T_opt-T_min)〗^α-〖(T_ref-T_min)〗^2α)/〖(T_opt-T_min)〗^2α    ■(&T_min≤T_ref≤T_max )\tEq. 5 \n\nThe ratio between f_T  and f_Tref was returned as the final Wang-Engle thermal day unit. T is the hourly interpolated air temperature. Tmin is the minimum temperature, 4°C. Topt is the optimum temperature, 29°C. Tmax is the maximum temperature, 38°C. Tref is the reference temperature, 25°C. Hourly interpolated values were averaged to get the Wang-Engle thermal day unit for a given day. Parameters were optimized for achieving the best prediction for flowering and véraison simultaneously. \n\nAfter summer solstice, the photoperiod decreases. When photoperiod decreases to a critical value (depends on variety and was set to 13.1 h in current model based on Camargo-Alvarez et al. (2020)), the bud for the growth of the following season enter into endodormancy. However, we could not reset the whole plant phenology into endodormancy at this time, as berries are still growing. Although it would be tidy to develop two different phenological clocks, one for the bud and one for the plant in growth, we decide to work around it by resetting the plant phenology phase into endodormancy at winter pruning which was defined in the management script. The chilling accumulation between the critical photoperiod and the pruning event was captured in another function and then added to the total chill accumulation in the endodormancy phase. \n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The phase look up function defines when new leaf appearance will happen, which is currently defined between budburst and véraison. The linear interpolation function defines how phyllochron changes with leaf rank based on the data presented in (Greer and Weston, 2010). \nBranching rate was calculated as the product of three components: potential branching rate, the effect of leaf area per vine, and the effects of retained bud number per meter row\n",

It predicted the appearance, expansion and senescence of cohorts of leaves at each position on the primary shoot and estimated how many leaves were present in each cohort based on branching rates. Branch leaves were treated the same as main-stem leaves appeared at the same time. \n\nThe maximum area of each cohort was currently set as a function of relative node position in respect to the final leaf number. The growth duration, lag duration, senescence duration and specific minimum and maximum leaf area were parameterised based on our field experiment, see Datasets used for Model calibration and validation. For correctly modelling leaf senescence and the dynamics of leaf area, a photoperiod acceleration effect was added. The photoperiod acceleration effect included and reflected the effects of the time of harvest on leaf senescence as well, as we observed that leaves would stay green much longer if the fruit were not harvested, See Supplementary Method 1 leaf module. Other leaf properties were parameterised to ensure no nitrogen or water stress on leaf expansion in the current grapevine model as the water and nitrogen dynamic part require further calibration. \n\nThe potential total DM demand of a leaf was calculated based upon the delta leaf area increase per day (constrained by stress) times the mean of maximum and minimum specific leaf area given in UI. The total DM demand was then divided into structural DM demand and Metabolic DM demand based on the fraction of structural DM in total leaf weight. The priority factor q for leaf structural and metabolic demand was set to a high value (1.6) as it is the immediate source of photosynthetic and has the highest priority early in the season (Buwalda, 1991; Lakso et al., 2008). Non-structural reserves were not considered in leaf current model. At leaf senescence, 50% of the total leaf DM was reallocated to other organs following the carbon allocation method, the other half was lost due to respiration to generate the energy required for the degradation and export metabolism in the face of declining photosynthesis (Keller, 2015). \n\nThe dynamics of seasonal canopy width and canopy depth were defined in the leaf class based on our field observation. \n",

The structural biomass growth curve was represented by a beta growth function (Yin et al., 2003) fitted on individual shoot weight over time and times the shoot population per square meter. Shoot population per square meter was calculated internally based on shoot number per vine and vine density. \nDMs(t)=〖SP*DM〗_max (1+ (t_e-t)/(t_e-t_m )) (t/t_e )^(t_e/(t_e-t_m ))              0≤t_m<t_e\t(Eq. 8)\nDMs(t) is the DM of all shoots (g m-2) at time t from budburst. SP the shoot population per square meter. DMmax is the fitted maximum DM per shoot under four-cane pruned vines (g). t_e is the time when DMmax was reached (79.2 td), t_m is the time at maximum growth rate (43 td). \n\nNote the shoot dry matter including both the primary and secondary shoots. For capturing the reduction of shoot biomass under high retained bud number per meter row caused both by smaller primary shoot and less lateral shoots (Greven et al., 2014), the priority factor for shoot DM demand was set to a very low value (4e-3). \n\nParameters for shoot non-structural DM demand, e.g. priority factors were set as half of the trunk and root. \n",

The structural DM demand of cordon and trunk (Eq. 6) were calculated by their radius (r, unit m) derived from their DM and length, daily growth rate of the radius (dr/dt, m d-1), length (l, m) and wood density (ρ, g m-3) (Cieslak et al., 2011). \n〖dStructuralDM〗_i/dt=q_(str,i) 2πrlρ dr/dt\t\tEq. 6\nwhere i was organ type. Qstr,i was the priority factor for structural DM demand for a certain organ, determined as 0.7 for all three organs see model calibration methods. Daily growth rate of the radius were calculated based on the trunk circumference measurements on the same eight hundreds vines with 14 years’ interval. \nThe structural carbon demand of the structural root was calculated by the structural demand of the trunk times the structural root/trunk ratio (set to one in this model). The structural root/trunk ratio may vary between vineyards and training systems. \n\nThe non-structural DM demand was modelled as an active competing sink (Cieslak et al., 2011), and the parameters were kept the same for those three organs. The rate of non-structural DM synthesis depended on organ size and limited by overloading. \n〖dNonStructuralDM〗_i/dt=q_(NSC,i)*k_syn*\n(C_(max,NSC)*〖StructuralDM〗_i-〖NonStructuralDM〗_i )\tEq. 7\nThe equation limited carbon storage owing to non-structural DM overloading and the organ storage capacity, which was proportional to the current organ structural biomass, Cmax,NSC was the maximum non-structural DM per unit of structural DM, set as 0.26 based on our field trunk and root samples (Greven et al., 2016). qNSC was set to 0.61 throughout the growing season. ksyn was daily non-structural DM synthesis rate, which was represented by a beta growth function Eq. 8 (Yin et al., 2003) for capturing the fast recovery of carbon reserves after flowering (Greven et al., 2016; Seleznyova et al., 2018). \n\nParameters were optimized based on the measured dynamics of non-structural carbon in trunk and root by Greven et al. (2016), see model calibration methods.\nk_syn=k_max (1+ (t_e-t)/(t_e-t_m )) (t/t_e )^(t_e/(t_e-t_m ))              0≤t_m<t_e\t(Eq. 8)\nk_max was the maximum non-structural DM synthesis rate, 0.03 g g-1. t_e was the thermal day after budburst when kmax was reached, 54 td (around véraison). t_m was the time when maximum increase rate occurred, 34.4 td.\nFor potential carbon retranslocation by those storage organs, a value of 3.7% each day (DMRetranslocationFactor) was obtained through optimization. Actual retranslocation depends on the daily carbon supply and demand differences. \nThe biomass of retained cane for following season was reset by the pruning events based on input cane diameter in the UI each year for the cane-pruned vines. The biomass of trunk and fibrous root keep growing each year. \n",

Bunch number, berry number and potential berry fresh weight were determined by weather conditions at critical periods around flowerings of the previous and current season, see details at Zhu et al., 2020 OENO one. Furthermore, in the current model, carbon effects represented by total carbon supply and demand were added in the calculation of bunch number, berry number and potential berry fresh weight. \n\nBerry dry mass accumulation following the source-sink carbon allocation rules. Brix was calculated based on the ratio of berry dry weight to fresh weight. Total titratable acid was simulated based on thermaltime accumulation after veraison follwoing a negative exponetial curve. \n\nA long-term phenology and yield monitoring trial using both two-cane and four-cane trained vertically shoot positioned (VSP) Sauvignon blanc vines was established in four vineyards in Marlborough, New Zealand in 2004, and was used for calibrating the berry module. Phenology, bunch number, berry mass, yield and meteorology records were collated. A multivariable mixed linear model was used to assess the relationship between various yield components and weather conditions. The critical periods for each yield component and weather factor were optimised based on the maximum likelihood returned from the mixed linear model. The optimised critical periods of temperature for all yield components occurred mainly before 50 % flowering either in the previous season (during inflorescence initiation) and the current season, indicating the importance of the pre-flowering period on yield formation. Out of all weather factors, maximum daily temperature had the largest effect on bunch number and overall yield and strongly influenced berry number and bunch mass. Rainfall near flowering time had a negative effect on berry mass and bunch mass, but post-flowering rainfall had a strong positive effect.",

The root organ is reponsible for uptake but can also supply both N and DM from its non-structural biomass.  The Fibrous root organ is used for simulating biomass storage and remobilisation because the current root class can not handle the biomass retranslocation.\n\nThe dynamics of root biomass was based on the root length dynamics measurement done on mature concord vines in UC Davis by comos et al., 2005. both root growth rate and mortality rate have annual cycles.Maintenance was set to zero as it was parameterized insided the senescence rate. \nthe maximum root biomass during the season is around 60 g per plant, estimated by lakso et al., 2008. \n\nthe initial weight of the root was increased as we start the simulation in February with no leaves.the start of simulation in February was for correctly simulating the budburst in the first year. the initial weight was given to ensure that the peak of the biomass can cycle around 30 g/m2.

Vines were trained using vertical shoot positioning (VSP), with an exposed leaf area height of 1.2 m, and trimmed to maintain a compact canopy. Vines were planted 1.8 m apart within the row, and 2.4 m apart between rows. Average flowering date was determined by monitoring all the inflorescences on one cane on a vine in each plot on a regular basis throughout flowering. Likewise, regular berry samples (at least weekly) were taken from before the date of véraison until harvest at a soluble solids concentration value of 21.5 oBrix. ",

Average flowering date was determined by monitoring all the inflorescences on one cane on a vine in each plot on a regular basis throughout flowering. Likewise, regular berry samples (at least weekly) were taken from before the date of véraison until harvest at a soluble solids concentration value of 21.5 oBrix. ",

Average flowering date was determined by monitoring all the inflorescences on one cane on a vine in each plot on a regular basis throughout flowering. Likewise, regular berry samples (at least weekly) were taken from before the date of véraison until harvest at a soluble solids concentration value of 21.5 oBrix. ",

Vines were trained using vertical shoot positioning (VSP), with an exposed leaf area height of 1.2 m, and trimmed to maintain a compact canopy. Vines were planted 1.8 m apart within the row, and 2.4 m apart between rows. Average flowering date was determined by monitoring all the inflorescences on one cane on a vine in each plot on a regular basis throughout flowering. Likewise, regular berry samples (at least weekly) were taken from before the date of véraison until harvest at a soluble solids concentration value of 21.5 oBrix. ",

Vines were trained using vertical shoot positioning (VSP), with an exposed leaf area height of 1.2 m, and trimmed to maintain a compact canopy. Vines were planted 1.8 m apart within the row, and 2.4 m apart between rows. Average flowering date was determined by monitoring all the inflorescences on one cane on a vine in each plot on a regular basis throughout flowering. Likewise, regular berry samples (at least weekly) were taken from before the date of véraison until harvest at a soluble solids concentration value of 21.5 oBrix. ",
