## What is sensitivity analysis and why is it useful?

Sensitivity analysis of crop models allows us to see a models response to changing various inputs.

There exist several examples demonstrating how sensitivity analysis can be performed. These examples can be found within the `Examples/Sensitivity` folder of your APSIM installation.

## Setup and Testing Instructions

1. If you haven't already you can download APSIM from [the APSIM registration site](https://registration.apsim.info)
2. Download R install from: [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm) and install with all default settings. <span style="color:red;">Note:</span> if you have Docker Desktop, you can ignore this step.
3. Open APSIM
4. Open the `Sensitivity_MorrisMethod.apsimx` example simulation from Example folder included in your apsim installation.
5. The simulation takes a minute or so depending on your system resources. This means you will not be able to interact with the APSIM window for that time span.
